1st data
Q: Shannon and her family use up a lot of strawberry and blueberry jelly , since they eat toast every morning . At the moment , they have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly . If they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly , how many grams of strawberry jelly do they have ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Shannon and her family have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly, which is equal to 4518 + x where x is the amount of strawberry jelly. Since we are given that they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly, we can set up the equation:
6310 = 4518 + x
Now, let's solve for x (the amount of strawberry jelly):
Subtracting 4518 from both sides gives us:
x = 1792
So, Shannon and her family have 1792 grams of strawberry jelly. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 1792

Q: Karin 's science class weighed plastic rings for an experiment . They found that the orange ring weighed 0.08333333333333333 ounce , the purple ring weighed 0.3333333333333333 ounce , and the white ring weighed 0.4166666666666667 ounce . What was the total weight of the plastic rings ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total weight of all the plastic rings is equal to the sum of their individual weights. So, we can write an equation like this:
Total weight = Orange + Purple + White
Now, let's substitute the values we know into the equation:
Total weight = 0.08333333333333333 + 0.3333333333333333 + 0.4166666666666667
Simplifying the equation gives us:
Total weight = 0.75 ounce
So, the total weight of the plastic rings is 0.75 ounces. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.75.

Q: Sandy grew 6 carrots . Sam grew 3 carrots . How many carrots did they grow in total ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Sandy grew 6 carrots, and Sam grew 3 carrots. To find out how many carrots they grew in total, we can add the number of carrots grown by each person together. So, the answer is:
6 + 3 = 9
Q: What is the value of x in the equation 4x - 7 = 25?
A: To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. First, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the negative number:
4x = 25 + 7
4x = 32
Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8
So, the value of x is 8. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 8

Q: Melanie bought a Batman game for $ 6.95 , a strategy game for $ 7.90 , and a Superman game for $ 7.73 . Melanie already owns 4 games . How much did Melanie spend on video games ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total cost of all three games is $ 21.58 ( $ 6.95 + $ 7.90 + $ 7.73). Since Melanie already owns four games, we can subtract the number of existing games from the total amount spent to find out how much she spent on new games. So, $ 21.58 - 4 = $ 17.58. Therefore, Melanie spent $ 17.58 on video games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: $ 17.58

Q: Dale 's Vegetarian Restaurant bought 2.8333333333333335 pounds of green peppers and 2.8333333333333335 pounds of red peppers . How many pounds of peppers did Dale 's Vegetarian Restaurant buy in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total weight of green peppers is 2.8333333333333335 pounds, and the total weight of red peppers is also 2.8333333333333335 pounds. Since both types of peppers are equally priced, we can simply add their weights together to find out how much pepper Dale's Vegetarian Restaurant bought in all :
Total weight of peppers = Green peppers + Red peppers
= 2.8333333333333335 + 2.8333333333333335
= 5.666666666666667 pounds
Therefore , Dale's Vegetarian Restaurant bought 5.666666666666667 pounds of peppers in all .

Q: A waitress put leftover tarts into the fridge on Thursday night . She noticed that the restaurant had 0.08333333333333333 tart filled with cherries , 0.75 tart filled with blueberries , and 0.08333333333333333 tart filled with peaches . How many leftover tarts did the restaurant have in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know there are three types of tarts, each with a different filling. So we can write down three equations:
1. For the tart filled with cherries: 0.08333333333333333 = x (where x is the number of tarts)
2. For the tart filled with blueberries: 0.75 = x (where x is the number of tarts)
3. For the tart filled with peaches: 0.08333333333333333 = x (where x is the number of tarts)
Now we need to find out how many tarts the restaurant had in total. To do this, we add up the numbers of tarts for each type of filling:
x + x + x = 0.08333333333333333 + 0.75 + 0.08333333333333333 = 1.96
So the restaurant had 1.96 leftover tarts in all.

Q: There were 2 red orchids and 4 white orchids in the vase . Jessica cut some red orchids from her flower garden . There are now 18 red orchids in the vase . How many red orchids did she cut ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there were originally 2 red orchids in the vase, plus 4 white orchids. So, the total number of orchids in the vase was 6 (2 red + 4 white).
Now, we learn that Jessica cut some red orchids from her flower garden. This means that the number of red orchids in the vase increased by however many she cut. Since there were already 2 red orchids in the vase, let's say she cut 3 more red orchids.
So, the new total number of red orchids in the vase is 5 (2 original + 3 additional = 5). And since there were also 4 white orchids in the vase before, the total number of orchids in the vase after Jessica added her cut flowers is 9 (5 red + 4 white).

Q: A spaceship traveled 0.5 light-year from Earth to Planet X and 0.1 light-year from Planet X to Planet Y. Then it traveled 0.1 light-year from Planet Y back to Earth . How many light-years did the spaceship travel in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.The distance between Earth and Planet X is 0.5 light-year, and the distance between Planet X and Planet Y is also 0.5 light-year (since they are equally spaced). So, the total distance traveled by the spaceship from Earth to Planet X is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 light-year. Now, the distance between Planet X and Planet Y is 0.1 light-year, so the total distance traveled by the spaceship from Planet X to Planet Y is 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6 light-year. Finally, the distance between Planet Y and Earth is 0.1 light-year, so the total distance traveled by the spaceship from Planet Y back to Earth is 0.6 + 0.1 = 0.7 light-year. Therefore, the spaceship traveled a total of 0.7 light-years.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Miki's sandcastle is $0.8333333333333334$ feet tall, and her sister's sandcastle is $0.5$ feet tall. So we can start by subtracting the height of her sister's sandcastle from the height of Miki's sandcastle:
$$ \text{Height of Miki's sandcastle} - \text{Height of her sister's sandcastle} = $$
$$ 0.8333333333333334 - 0.5 = $$
$$ 0.3333333333333334 $$
So Miki's sandcastle is $0.3333333333333334$ feet taller than her sister's sandcastle.

Q: Scarlett made a fruit salad with 0.25 pound of melon and 0.375 pound of berries . How many pounds of fruit did Scarlett use in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total weight of the fruit is equal to the sum of the weights of the different types of fruit. So, we can write an equation like this:
Weight of fruit = weight of melon + weight of berries
Now, we know the weight of the melon (0.25 lb) and the weight of the berries (0.375 lb), so we can plug these values into our equation:
Weight of fruit = 0.25 lb + 0.375 lb
Weight of fruit = 0.625 lb

Q: Kenji and his classmates placed colored blocks on a scale during a science lab . The yellow block weighed 0.6 pounds and the green block weighed 0.4 pounds . How much more did the yellow block weigh than the green block ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total weight of all the blocks is equal to the weight of the scale, which is 2 pounds. So, we can write an equation:
Total weight = 2 pounds
Now, let's find out how much each block weighs:
Yellow block weight = X pounds (since it weighs 0.6 pounds)
Green block weight = Y pounds (since it weighs 0.4 pounds)
We want to find out how much more the yellow block weighs than the green block, so we need to subtract Y from X:
Difference in weight = X - Y
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
Difference in weight = 0.6 pounds - 0.4 pounds
= 0.2 pounds
So, the yellow block weighs 0.2 pounds more than the green block. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.2 pounds

A: Let's think step by step.We know that there were originally 28 bales of hay in the barn, and then Tim stacked some more bales in the barn today. So, let's call the number of bales that Tim stacked x.
We also know that after Tim stacked the bales, there are now 54 bales of hay in the barn. This means that the total number of bales in the barn is 28 + x = 54.
Now we can solve for x by subtracting 28 from both sides of the equation:
x = 54 - 28 = 26
So Tim stored 26 bales of hay in the barn today.

Q: Dan 's cat had kittens and 5 had spots . He gave 7 to Tim and 4 to Jason . He now has 5 kittens . How many kittens did he have to start with ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Dan's cat had kittens, and 5 of them had spots. So the total number of kittens = 5 + however many non-spotted kittens there were. Then we are given that Dan gave 7 kittens to Tim and 4 to Jason. This means that after giving away some kittens, Dan had 5 - 7 - 4 = 4 kittens left. Finally, we are told that Dan now has 5 kittens, so the number of kittens he had to start with must be equal to the number he has now minus the ones he gave away: 5 = 4 + x, where x is the number of kittens he had to start with. Solving for x, we get x = 9. Therefore, Dan's cat had 9 kittens to start with. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the height of the old lamp is 1 foot, which is equal to 12 inches. So, we can start by finding out how many inches the new lamp is taller than the old lamp. To do this, we need to convert the height of the new lamp from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we can multiply the height of the new lamp (which is 2.3333333333333335 feet) by 12 to get its height in inches:
2.3333333333333335 × 12 = 27.999999999999996 inches
Now, we can see that the new lamp is 27.999999999999996 inches taller than the old lamp.

Q: Kendra made punch for her friend 's birthday party . She used 0.25 gallon of grape juice , 0.375 gallon of cranberry juice , and 0.125 gallon of club soda . How many gallons of punch did Kendra make ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total volume of all three liquids is equal to the volume of the punch. So, we can set up an equation like this:
Gallons of grape juice + Gallons of cranberry juice + Gallons of club soda = Gallons of punch
We are given that:
Gallons of grape juice = 0.25 gallons
Gallons of cranberry juice = 0.375 gallons
Gallons of club soda = 0.125 gallons
So, we can substitute these values into our equation:
0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125 = x
Now, we need to solve for "x", which represents the number of gallons of punch that Kendra made. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by the sum of the volumes of the grape juice, cranberry juice, and club soda:
x / (0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125) = x
Simplifying this equation gives us:
x =  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.625 gallons of punch that Kendra made.

Q: Each year , salmon travel upstream , going from the ocean to the rivers where they were born . This year , 712261 male and 259378 female salmon returned to their rivers . How many salmon made the trip ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are more males than females, so we can start by finding out how many males returned to their rivers. If 712261 is the number of male salmon, then the ratio of males to females is 712261 : 259378 = 2.84. So, if we want to find out how many females returned to their rivers, we can multiply the total number of salmon by this ratio: 712261 x 2.84 = 190907 females. Therefore, a total of 712261 + 190907 = 903178 salmon made the trip. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is903178.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total weight of all ingredients is equal to the sum of their individual weights, so we can write an equation based on this idea:
Weight of trail mix = weight of peanuts + weight of chocolate chips + weight of raisins
Now, let's substitute the given values into the equation:
Weight of trail mix = 0.16666666666666666 + 0.16666666666666666 + 0.08333333333333333
Simplifying the equation, we get:

A: Let's think step by step.If Kelly bought 0.1 pounds of peanuts, that means she bought x number of ounces of peanuts, where x is a whole number (since you can't have a fraction of an ounce). Similarly, if she bought 0.4 pounds of raisins, that means she bought y number of ounces of raisins, where y is also a whole number.
Now we need to find out how many ounces of snacks Kelly bought altogether. We know that the total weight of the snacks she bought is equal to the sum of the weights of the peanuts and raisins she bought. So we can write the equation:
x + y = 0.1 + 0.4

We are also given that 660 gallons of white paint were used, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
6689 = 660 + B
Where B is the number of gallons of blue paint used.
Now we need to solve for B. To do this, we can subtract 660 from both sides of the equation:
609 = B

Q: Mike went to 15 basketball games this year , but missed 41 . He went to 39 games last year . How many basketball games did Mike go to in total ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Mike went to 15 basketball games this year, and he missed 41 games. So the number of games he attended is equal to the number of games he didn't attend minus the number of games he attended this year.
Last year, Mike went to 39 games. Therefore, we can write an equation:
Total games = Last year's games - This year's games + Missed games
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Total games = 39 - 15 + 41
Total games = 73
So, Mike went to 73 basketball games in total.

A: Let's think step by step.Before buying the pie, Mary had $X dollars. She spent $6 on the pie, so now she has $X - $6 = $X - 6 dollars. Her friend also had $Y dollars before buying the pie (where Y is not equal to X). Now, after spending $6 on the pie, Mary has $X - 6 dollars and her friend has $Y - 6 dollars. We are told that Mary has 52 dollars and her friend has 43 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
$X - 6 = 52 ...(1)$
$Y - 6 = 43 ...(2)$
Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously. From equation (1), we get:
$X = 58$
And from equation (2), we get:
$Y = 37$
So, before buying the pie, Mary had $58 dollars and her friend had $37 dollars.

Q: Suzie found 2 worms in the yard and measured them with a ruler . 1 worm was 0.8 inch long . The other worm was 0.1 inch long . How much longer was the longer worm ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that one of the worms is 0.8 inches long, which means it is 8/10 of an inch long (since there are 10 inches in 1 foot). And we also know that the shorter worm is 0.1 inches long, which means it is 1/10 of an inch long (again, since there are 10 inches in 1 foot). Now, to find out how much longer the longer worm is, we need to subtract the length of the shorter worm from the length of the longer worm. So, if the longer worm is 0.8 inches long, and the shorter worm is 0.1 inches long, then the difference between their lengths is:
0.8 - 0.1 = 0.7 inches
So, the longer worm is 0.7 inches longer than the shorter worm.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the sum of Paul's score and his cousin's score is equal to 5816. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Paul's score + Cousin's score = 5816 ... (1)
We are given in the problem that Paul scored 3103 points while playing the video game. So, we can substitute this value into equation (1):
3103 + Cousin's score = 5816 ... (2)
Now, we are also given that Paul and his cousin together have a total of 5816 points. This means that Paul's score plus his cousin's score must be equal to 5816. Using equation (2), we can see that:
3103 + Cousin's score = 5816 ... (3)
Now, we need to solve for Cousin's score. To do this, we can subtract 3103 from both sides of equation (3):
Cousin's score = 5816 - 3103 = 2713 ... (4)
Therefore,

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Craig rode the bus for 3.8333333333333335 miles, so he traveled a total distance of 3.8333333333333335 + 0.16666666666666666 = 4 miles. Now we need to find out how far he walked. Since he walked 0.16666666666666666 miles, he walked half of that distance, which is 0.08333333333333333 miles. So, the difference between the distance he rode and the distance he walked is 4 - 0.08333333333333333 = 3.916666666666667 miles. Therefore, Craig rode 3.916666666666667 miles more than he walked.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Kelly's chemistry textbook weighs 7.125 pounds, so let's call this weight x. Then, we know that her geometry textbook weighs 0.625 pounds, which is less than x. So, if we want to find out how much more the chemistry textbook weighs than the geometry textbook, we can subtract 0.625 from x:
x - 0.625 = 7.125
Now we have a simple equation:
x = 7.125 + 0.625
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7.75
So, Kelly's chemistry textbook weighs 7.75 pounds more than her geometry textbook.

Q: A worker at a medical lab is studying blood samples . 2 samples contained a total of 7341 blood cells . The first sample contained 4221 blood cells . How many blood cells were in the second sample ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of blood cells in both samples together is 7341. Since the first sample had 4221 blood cells, we can find out how many blood cells are in the second sample by subtracting the number of blood cells in the first sample from the total number of blood cells. So, the number of blood cells in the second sample is:
7341 - 4221 = 3120
Therefore, there were 3120 blood cells in the second sample. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 3120

Q: A construction company ordered 0.16666666666666666 ton of concrete , 0.16666666666666666 ton of bricks , and 0.5 ton of stone . How many tons of material did the company order in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the company ordered 0.16666666666666666 ton of concrete, which is equal to 0.167 tons (since there are 0.625 tons in a ton). Similarly, we can convert the other quantities as follows:
* Bricks: 0.16666666666666666 ton = 0.167 tons
* Stone: 0.5 ton = 0.5 x 0.625 = 0.3125 tons
Now, let's add up the total amount of material the company ordered:
Tons of concrete = 0.167
Tons of bricks = 0.167
Tons of stone = 0.3125
Total tons of material = Ton of concrete + Ton of bricks + Ton of stone
= 0.167 + 0.167 + 0.3125
= 0.64675 tons
Therefore, the company ordered 0.64675 tons of

Q: Joan found 72 seashells and 12 starfishes on the beach . She gave Alyssa some of her seashells . She has 28 seashell . How many seashells did she give to Alyssa ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Joan had a total of 72 seashells, and then she gave some to Alyssa. So, after giving some to Alyssa, Joan had fewer seashells left. Specifically, we are told that she has 28 seashells left now.
So, if Joan had x seashells before giving any to Alyssa, and she gave y seashells to Alyssa, then we can write an equation based on this information:
x + y = 72 (total number of seashells) - 28 (number of seashells Joan has left)
Now we need to solve for y, which is the number of seashells Joan gave to Alyssa. To do this, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:
y = 72 - x
We don't know what x is yet, but we can substitute it with whatever value we want to use for Joan's initial number of seashells. For example, let's say Joan had 30 seashells initially. Then we would have:
y = 72 - 30
y = 42

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount of sugar used is equal to the sum of the amounts of both sugars, so we can write an equation:
brown sugar + white sugar = total sugar
We are given that Victor used 0.625 scoops of brown sugar and 0.25 scoops of white sugar. To find out how much more brown sugar Victor used, we need to subtract the amount of white sugar from the total amount of sugar:
total sugar - white sugar = brown sugar
Substituting the values we know into this equation gives us:
0.625 + 0.25 = x
Solving for x (where x represents the number of scoops of brown sugar), we get:
x = 0.375
So Victor used 0.375 more scoops of brown sugar than white sugar.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Michelle started with 0.5 tanks of gas, which means she had 0.5 gallons of gas. Since she used some amount of gas during her delivery route, let's call it x gallons. So, the total amount of gas Michelle had after making the deliveries is:
0.5 + x = 0.16666666666666666
Now we can solve for x:
x = 0.16666666666666666 - 0.5
x = 0.08333333333333334
So, Michelle used approximately 0.08333333333333334 gallons of gas during her delivery route.

Therefore, the total distance Nina ran during her drill is:
0.0833333333333333 + 0.1666666666666667 = 0.25 miles
So, Nina ran 0.25 miles during her running drill.

Q: Each of farmer Cunningham 's 6048 lambs is either black or white . There are 193 white ones . How many of Farmer Cunningham 's lambs are black ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of lambs owned by Farmer Cunningham is 6048, and we also know that there are 193 white lambs among them. So, if x is the number of black lambs, we can write the equation:
Total Number of Lambs = 6048 ( since all lambs belong to Farmer Cunningham)
Number of White Lambs = 193 ( given )
Now, let's solve for x (the number of black lambs):
x + 193 = 6048 ...(1)
Now, subtracting 193 from both sides gives us:
x = 5115 (black lambs)
Therefore, Farmer Cunningham has 5115 black lambs.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Dan spent $ 11.76 on a snake toy, so we can write an equation for this:
$ 11.76 = x (where x is the cost of the snake toy)
We also know that Dan paid $ 14.54 for a cage, so we can write another equation for this:
$ 14.54 = y (where y is the cost of the cage)
Since Dan found a dollar bill on the ground, he has $ 1 more than he spent on his purchases. So, the total cost of Dan's purchases is equal to the sum of the costs of the snake toy and the cage plus the amount he found on the ground:
Total Cost = x + y + $ 1
Now we have three equations and three variables! Can you use these equations to find out the total cost of Dan's purchases?

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total weight of sand in the truck is 4.1 pounds, so we can write an equation like this:
Weight of sand = 4.1 pounds
Now we are told that the truck lost 2.4 pounds of sand along the way. This means that the amount of sand left in the truck is equal to the original weight minus the weight that was lost:
Amount of sand left = Weight of sand - Weight lost
= 4.1 pounds - 2.4 pounds

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Tom spent $ 9.46 on the skateboard, so we can write this amount as S (for "skateboard"). Next, we know that he spent $ 9.56 on marbles, so we can write this amount as M (for "marbles"). Finally, we know that he spent $ 14.50 on shorts, so we can write this amount as S (for "shorts").
Now let's add up all of these amounts:
S + M + S = Total cost of toys
= $ 9.46 + $ 9.56 + $ 14.50
= $ 33.52
So Tom spent a total of $ 33.52 on toys. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 33.52

Q: Paco 's Countertop Company purchased pieces of marble from a quarry . The weights of the pieces they purchased were 0.3333333333333333 ton , 0.3333333333333333 ton , and 0.08333333333333333 ton . How many tons of marble did Paco 's Countertop Company purchase in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total weight of the three pieces is equal to the sum of their individual weights, so we can write an equation like this:
0.333333333333333 + 0.333333333333333 + 0.0833333333333333 = x
where "x" represents the total weight of the marble Paco's Countertop Company purchased.
Now, let's substitute the given values for each piece into the equation:
0.333333333333333 + 0.333333333333333 + 0.0833333333333333 = x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2.746666666666665 = x
So, Paco's Countertop Company purchased 2.746666666666665 tons of marble in all. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 2.746666666666665

Q: Mary found 45 seashells , Melanie found 23 seashells , and Jason found 32 seashells on the beach . When they cleaned them , they discovered that 31 were cracked . How many seashells did they find together ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Mary found 45 seashells, Melanie found 23 seashells, and Jason found 32 seashells in total. So, we can write this as a sum: 45 + 23 + 32 = x (where x is the total number of seashells they found). Now, we are told that when they cleaned them, they discovered that 31 were cracked. This means that after cleaning, there were only 31 usable seashells left out of the total number they found. So, we can set up another equation: x - 31 = 31 (where x is the total number of seashells they found before cleaning). Now, we need to solve both equations simultaneously to find the answer. Can you do that? 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is99.

Q: Hoping to be named Salesperson of the Month , Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week . This week , she called the people listed on another 8.6 pages of the same phone book . How many pages worth of people did Rosa call in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.If Rosa called 10.2 pages of the phone book last week, that means she called every name on those pages. So, there are 10.2 pages x number of names per page = total number of names called.
This week, Rosa called an additional 8.6 pages of the phone book. So, the total number of names she called this week is 8.6 pages x number of names per page = total number of names called.
Adding up the numbers from both weeks gives us the total number of pages worth of people Rosa called: 10.2 + 8.6 = 18.8 pages.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 0.16666666666666666 one-bedroom apartments in total, and we want to find out what fraction of them are one-bedroom apartments. So, let's divide the number of one-bedroom apartments by the total number of apartments:

Q: Christina just transferred $ 69 out of her bank account . As a result , the account now has $ 26935 in it . How much money was in the account before the transfer ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that after the transfer, the amount in the account is $ 26935 . So we can set up an equation using this information :
$ 26935 = $ x + $ 69 where $ x $ represents the original amount in the account before the transfer .
Now we need to solve for $ x $ . To do this , we subtract $ 69 from both sides of the equation :
$ 26935 - $ 69 = $ x
This simplifies to :
$ 26266 = $ x

Mary's total spending = Shop A + Shop B
We know that Mary spent $13.04 at Shop A and $12.27 at Shop B, so we can plug these values into our equation:
Mary's total spending = $13.04 + $12.27

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Joan attended 395 games and her high school played a total of 864 games, including both daytime and nighttime games. So, we can write an equation based on these values:
Number of games Joan attended = Total number of games x Percentage of games Joan attended
In this case, the percentage of games Joan attended is 395/864 = 0.45 or 45%. Now, we need to find out how many games Joan missed. To do this, we subtract the number of games she attended from the total number of games:
Number of games Joan missed = Total number of games - Number of games Joan attended
Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:
Number of games Joan missed = 864 - 395 = 479
So, Joan missed 479 baseball games.

Q: There are 43 maple trees and 22 orange trees currently in the park . Park workers will plant maple trees today . When the workers are finished there will be 54 maple trees in the park . How many maple trees did the workers plant today ?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that initially, there were 43 maple trees in the park. Now, we are told that "park workers will plant maple trees today." This means that after they finish their work, there will be more maple trees than before. So, the total number of maple trees in the park after the workers have finished planting will be 54 (as stated in the problem). Therefore, the number of maple trees planted by the workers today is equal to 54 - 43 = 11. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is11.

Q: Ella owns 2 dogs . Each day , 1 dog eats 0.125 scoop of dog food and the other dog eats 0.125 scoop . Together , how much dog food do the 2 dogs eat each day ?
A: Let's think step by step.
Ella has 2 dogs, so together they eat a total amount of dog food per day.
Each dog eats 0.125 scoops of dog food per day, so one dog eats 0.125 x 2 = 0.25 scoops of dog food per day.
Therefore, the two dogs eat a total of 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 scoops of dog food per day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.5
