Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount of sugar needed is 12 cups, and Mary has already added 10 cups. So, we subtract 10 from 12 to get the remaining amount of sugar:
12 - 10 = 2
Now, let's find out how much flour is left to be added. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, and Mary has already added 10 cups. So, we subtract 10 from 14 to get the remaining amount of flour:
14 - 10 = 4
Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour than cups of sugar. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers at the park. Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Danny had 15 bottle caps before finding any new ones at the park, so we can write this down as C = 15. Then we know that he found 18 wrappers at the park, so we can write this down as W = 18. Finally, we are told that Danny already had 67 wrappers in his collection, so we can write this down as W + W = 67. Solving for W, we get W = 49. So, Danny has 49 more wrappers than bottle caps. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is49.

Q: Melissa scored a total of 21 points playing some games. Is she scored 7 points in each game. How many games did she play?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of points Melissa scored is 21, and since she played some games, we can write an equation:
Total points = Number of games x Points per game
We are given that Melissa scored 7 points in each game, so if she played n games, her total score would be:
Total points = n x 7
Now, we want to solve for n (the number of games). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
n = Total points / 7
Substituting the value we were given (21), we get:
n = 21 / 7
n = 3
So, Melissa played 3 games! 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour 14 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount of each ingredient needed for the recipe is:
* Flour = 12 cups
* Sugar = 14 cups
* Salt = 7 cups

Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so we need to find out how much more flour she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:
12 cups - 2 cups = 10 cups
So, Mary needs to add 10 more cups of flour to the recipe.
Now, let's check if she needs to add more salt or not:
7 cups (total amount of salt) - 2 cups (amount already added) = 5 cups
Yes, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of salt to the recipe. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

Q: Paul sold some books in a garage sale leaving him with 27 books. If he had 136 books initially How many books did he sell?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the number of books Paul has after selling some is equal to the number of books he had initially minus the number of books he sold. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Number of books Paul has after selling = Initial number of books - Number of books sold
In this case, the initial number of books was 136 (given), and the number of books sold was 27 (also given). Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation above and solve for the number of books Paul sold:
Number of books Paul has after selling = 136 - 27
= 109
So, Paul sold 109 books at his garage sale.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 78 per t-shirt sold, so if they sold x t-shirts during the Arkansas game, they made $ 78x dollars. Similarly, if they sold y t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, they made $ 78y dollars. Since we are given that the total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 186, we can set up the equation: $ 78x + $ 78y = 186. Solving for y, we get y = 104. So, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 78 \* 104 = $ 8356 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

A: Let's think step by step.At first, there were some birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came to join them. So, in total, there are 5 birds on the fence now. To find out how many birds had been sitting on the fence at the start, we can divide the number of birds on the fence now (5) by the number of birds that came to join them (4). This means that 4 birds had been sitting on the fence at the start. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's think step by step.We know from the problem statement that a total of 457 students made suggestions for the school lunch menu, and some of them suggested adding mashed potatoes. Specifically, we are told that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon. So, if x is the number of students who suggested bacon, then we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 63 = 457
Now, let's solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 63 from both sides of the equation:
x = 457 - 63
x = 394
So, there were 394 students who suggested adding bacon to the school lunch menu. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is394

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the Razorback shop made $ 240 off each t-shirt, so if they sold x t-shirts, then the total amount of money they earned from selling t-shirts is $ 240x . Similarly, we know that the Razorback shop made $ 210 off each jersey, so if they sold y jerseys, then the total amount of money they earned from selling jerseys is $ 210y . Since you said that they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, we can set up the following equation: $$ \begin{aligned} 240x + 210y &= 210 \\ 240x - 210y &= 23 \end{aligned}$$ Solving for x and y, we get: $$ \begin{aligned} x &= 177 \\ y &= 23 \end{aligned}$$ So, a t-shirt costs $ 240 / 177 = $ 1.35 more than

Q: There are 896 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 517 erasers and 90 scales. If the skittles are organized into 8 groups How big is each group?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steven's collection, so we can write an equation: 896 = x × 8 where "x" represents the number of groups. Since Steven has 517 erasers and 90 scales, we know that 517 + 90 = x, which means that Steven has a total of x objects (erazers+scales). Now we have two equations: 896=x×8 and 517+90=x. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of each equation. For the first equation, we can divide both sides by 8: 896/8 = x. For the second equation, we can subtract 90 from both sides: 517 = x-90. Now we have two equations with two variables, and we can use substitution or elimination to find the values of x and y. Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for x, we get x = 896/8 = 112. Substituting this value back into the second equation, we get

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's think step by step.We know from the problem statement that a total of 182 students made suggestions for the school lunch menu, and some of them suggested adding mashed potatoes. However, we are told in the question that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. So, if x is the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes, then the number of students who suggested bacon is 166 + x.
Now, we can use the information given in the problem to find out how many students suggested bacon. Since there were 182 students in total, and 166 more students suggested bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes, we can set up the equation:
x + (166) = 182
Solving for x, we get:
x = 116
So, 116 students suggested mashed potatoes, and therefore 166 + 116 = 282 students suggested bacon. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is282.

Q: Dave had 59 files and 15 apps on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 12 apps and 30 files left. How many apps did he delete?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Dave started with 15 apps, so if he deleted some apps, the number of apps he has now is less than 15. Also, we know that he had 59 files initially, which means he still has 30 files after deleting some files (or apps). So, to find out how many apps Dave deleted, we can set up a proportion:
Number of apps = Initial apps - Apps after deletion
= 15 - Number of apps he has now
Now, let's solve for "number of apps he has now":
Number of apps he has now = 15 - x
Where x is the number of apps Dave deleted.
We are given that the total number of apps he has now is 12, so we can substitute this value in the equation:
12 = 15 - x
Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:
-3 = x
So, Dave deleted 3 apps. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount of flour needed is 9 cups, and Mary has already added 4 cups. So, there are 5 remaining cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5). Now, we can find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add by subtracting the number of cups of flour from the total amount of sugar needed: 11 cups - 5 cups = 6 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Q: Dave had 16 apps and 77 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 5 apps and 23 files left. How many apps did he delete?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Dave started with 16 apps and 77 files. If he deleted some apps, the number of apps he had afterward is less than 16. So, let's say he deleted x apps. Now we have a total of 16 - x apps.
We also know that after deleting some apps and files, he had 5 apps left. So, the number of apps he deleted (x) must be greater than or equal to 5.
Now, let's find out how many files he deleted. He had 77 files initially, and after deleting some files, he had 23 files left. So, the number of files he deleted (y) can be found as follows:
Number of files he deleted = Total initial files - Number of files left after deletion
= 777 - 23
= 54
Therefore, Dave deleted 5 apps and 54 files from his phone. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is(5, 54).

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of salt. She already put in 12 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount of sugar, flour, and salt needed for the recipe is 11 + 6 + 9 = 26 cups. Since Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, we can subtract this amount from the total amount of ingredients needed: 26 - 12 = 14 cups. So, Mary needs to add 14 cups of sugar and 0 cups of salt (since she has already added 9 cups).

Q: A book has 3 chapters. The first chapter is 53 pages long the second chapter is 75 pages long and the third chapter is 21 pages long. How many more pages does the first chapter have than the third chapter?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the first chapter is 53 pages long, the second chapter is 75 pages long, and the third chapter is 21 pages long. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, we can write:
Number of pages in first chapter - Number of pages in third chapter = 53 - 21 = 32
So, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is32 .

Q: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Debby has 360 soda bottles, which means she will drink 9/360 = 1/40 of them per day. Since she also drank 122 water bottles per day, we can subtract this amount from the total number of bottles to find out how long the soda bottles will last. So, the number of days the soda bottles will last is:
Number of soda bottles left = Total number of soda bottles - Number of water bottles drunk per day x Number of days debby drank water bottles
= 360 - (122 x 30)
= 360 - 3600
= -324
So, the soda bottles will last for -324 days or approximately 875 days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is(-324) × 365 = -133,660 days or approximately 3 years and 8 months.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that there were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace and 661 visitors came to the palace on that day. Now we want to find out how many more visitors came on that day compared to the previous day. So let's use the information given in the question: if there were 600 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the number of visitors on that day and the previous day is equal to the number of visitors on that day minus 600.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 5 dollars off each jersey and $ 215 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 jerseys. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that for every t-shirt, the Razorback shop makes $215 in profit. So if they sell x t-shirts, then the total amount of money made from t-shirts is $215x.
We also know that the Razorback shop makes $5 off each jersey. So if they sell y jerseys, then the total amount of money made from jerseys is $5y.
Now we have two equations:
$215x + $5y = $1398 (total amount of money made)
$5x + $215y = $768 (total amount of money made)
Can you use these equations to find out how much money the Razorback shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game?

A: Let's think step by step.We know that 5 sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day, so let's call this value "x". The number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day is 74 - x. Since we want to find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested than ripe oranges, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:
Number of sacks of unripe oranges = 74 - x
Now we need to solve for "x", which is the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day. To do this, we can subtract 74 from both sides of the equation:
x = 5 - (74)
x = -69
So there are 69 more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges harvested per day.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that 47 bird families flew away to Africa, so we can write this down as 47 birds x family = total number of birds flying away to Africa. Similarly, we know that 94 bird families flew away to Asia, so we can write this down as 94 birds x family = total number of birds flying away to Asia. Now, let's find out how many more birds flew away to Asia than to Africa: Total number of birds flying away to Asia - Total number of birds flying away to Africa = (94 x family) - (47 x family) = 47 families - 47 families = 0 families Since there are no negative numbers in mathematics, it means that exactly equal number of birds flew away to both Africa and Asia. So, the answer is 0. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.

Q: Frank had some pieces of candy. If he put them into 26 bags with 33 pieces in each bag How many pieces of candy did he have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of pieces of candy is equal to the number of bags multiplied by the number of pieces in each bag. So, if we have 26 bags and each bag has 33 pieces of candy, then the total number of pieces of candy is:
26 x 33 = 840
So, Frank had 840 pieces of candy. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 840

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the depth of the cave is 762 - 659 = 103 feet. So, to find out how far it is until they reach the end of the cave, we need to divide the total depth of the cave (103 feet) by the height they have reached so far (659 feet):
103 ft / 659 ft = 0.158 or approximately 16% of the way down the cave remains until they reach the end.

Q: Nell collects cards. She had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Nell started with 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards, for a total of 456 cards. Then she gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced the number of cards she had. So, let's call the number of baseball cards she had after giving them to Jeff x. Since we know that x + 18 = 55 (the number of Ace cards she has left), we can set up an equation:
x + 18 = 55 ... (1)
Now, we want to find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. To do this, we need to subtract the number of Ace cards from the total number of baseball cards:
Number of baseball cards = Total cards - Number of Ace cards
= 456 - 18
= 438
So, Nell has 438 more baseball cards than Ace cards. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is438.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Baker made 54 cakes in total, and we want to find out how many cakes he sold. So let's start with the information given in the problem: "Baker still has 13 cakes left." This means that after selling some cakes, Baker still has 13 cakes remaining. Now, we need to use our reasoning skills to figure out how many cakes Baker sold.
Let's assume that Baker sold x cakes. Since he still has 13 cakes left, this means that x + 13 = 54 (total number of cakes). Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 41
So, Baker sold 41 cakes!

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the Razorback shop made $ 115 per jersey and $ 25 per t-shirt, so we can write down these values as follows:
Jersey: $ 115
T-Shirt: $ 25
Now let's find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game:
T-Shirts = Number of t-shirts sold / Total number of items sold
= 113 / (113 + 78)
= 0.56 or approximately 56%
So, the Razorback shop sold approximately 56% of t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. Now we want to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt:
Cost difference between Jerseys and T-Shirts = Cost of a jersey - Cost of a t-shirt

So, if he didn't lose any crayons, then he must have gained some during the school year. Specifically, he gained 140 crayons (531 - 391 = 140). Now let's check how many erasers he has. He started with 38 erasers and didn't lose any, so he still has 38 erasers at the end of the school year. Therefore, he has 140 more crayons than erasers left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: $140$

Q: Nell collects cards. She had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Nell started with 38 Ace cards and 239 baseball cards, for a total of 277 cards. Then she gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced the number of cards she had. After giving some away, Nell had 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards. To find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of Ace cards:
376 - 111 = 265
So, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is265.

Q: Mom buys 70 white t - shirts in total. If white t - shirts can be purchased in packages and mom buys 14 packages How many white t - shirts does each package have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of white T-shirts is 70, so we need to find out how many are in each package. We also know that Mom bought 14 packages, so let's divide the total number of T-shirts by the number of packages:
70 / 14 = x
Now we need to solve for X, which represents the number of white T-shirts in each package. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14:
x = 70 / 14
So there are 5 white T-shirts in each package! 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

Q: Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
A: Let's think step by step.Since each room is 19 feet long, we can divide that number by 3 (since there are 3 dimensions - length, width, and height) to get the area of one room:
Area = Length x Width = 19 ft x 18 ft = 342 sq ft
Since Jesse has 20 rooms in total, she needs to cover the floors of all rooms with carpet. So, the total area of carpet needed is:
Total Area = Number of Rooms x Room Area = 20 x 342 sq ft = 6,840 sq ft
Therefore, Jesse needs 6,840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms.

Now, we need to solve for $x$, which represents the cost of the candy bar. To do this, we can add $4$ to both sides of the equation:
$4 - $ x + $4 = $3 + $4
Simplifying the equation, we get:
-$x = $7
So, the candy bar cost $7$. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$7$.

Q: For Gwen's birthday she received 7 dollars. She spent some money and has 5 dollars left with her. How much money did she spend?
A: Let's think step by step.If Gwen received $7 for her birthday, that means she had $0 before (since you can't receive more than what you already have). So if she spent some money, the amount she spent is equal to the amount of money she had minus the amount she received ($5 - $7 = -$2). Since she still has $5 after spending, we know that she didn't spend any money, so the answer is $0. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms. 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each school bus. How many students are in the school?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school, and each classroom can accommodate around 30-40 students (let's assume an average of 35 students per classroom). So, the total number of students in all classrooms = 84 x 35 = 2960 students.
Now, we need to calculate how many students will be going on the field trip. Since 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each bus, the total number of students who can go on the field trip = 95 x 118 = 11,170 students.
So, the difference between the total number of students in the school and those who can go on the field trip = Total number of students in the school - Number of students who can go on the field trip = 2960 - 11,170 = -8,210 students.
Therefore, there are no students in the school who can go on the field trip.

Bananas: 72 / 6 = 12 groups (since there are 12 bananas left after splitting)
Marbles: 66 / 6 = 11 groups (since there are 11 marbles left after splitting)

So, if we want to find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested than unripe oranges, we can subtract the number of sacks of unripe oranges from the total number of sacks of oranges harvested:
More sacks of ripe oranges = Total number of sacks - Number of sacks of unripe oranges
= 127 - 41

Q: Paul got a box of 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 523 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Paul received a total of 457 erasers and 617 crayons as gifts. If at the end of the school year, he had 523 crayons left, then he must have lost some crayons. So, let's subtract the number of crayons he lost from the initial amount to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left.
Let X be the number of crayons Paul lost. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:
Total number of crayons = 617 - X
Number of erasers = 457
Now, we want to find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left. To do this, we need to subtract the number of erasers (457) from the total number of crayons (617):
More crayons than erasers = 617 - 457 = 160
So, Paul had 160 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 102 classrooms. There are 11 students in the school and 99 seats on each school bus. If 8 students do n't want to go for the trip How many students are going on the trip?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 102 classrooms, which means there are 102 x 11 = 1111 students in the school. Since 99 seats are available on each bus, we can divide the number of students who don't want to go (8) by the number of seats available per bus (99): 8 / 99 = 0.08. So, approximately 8% of the students will not be able to go on the field trip. Therefore, out of 1111 students, around 93 students (1111 x 0.08) will go on the field trip. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 93 .

Q: Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 5 feet long What is the width of her room?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Jesse wants a carpet of size 10 square feet, which means it has an area of 10 square feet = 10 x 10 = 100 square inches. Since we are given that the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet, we can find its width as follows: Area of the room = Length x Width = 5 x Width (since the room is rectangular) So, we need to divide the area of the carpet (100 square inches) by the area of the room (5 x Width): 100 / 5 x Width = Width = 20 inches Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 20 inches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is20.

A: Let's think step by step.The length of Jesse's room is 2 feet, which means we can divide it into 2 equal parts. Each part will be 2/2 = 1 foot. Now, let's find out how many tiles are needed for one foot. Since each tile is of size 4 square feet, we can say that one foot needs 4 square feet / 4 = 1 square foot of tiles. Therefore, to cover a single foot of Jesse's room, she needs 1 square foot \* 12 feet (width of the room) = 12 square feet of tiles. To cover the entire floor of Jesse's room, she needs 12 square feet / 4 square feet per tile = 3 tiles. So, Jesse needs 3 tiles to cover the entire floor of her room.

Q: You had 14 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total How many bags of cookies do you have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of cookies is 28, so each bag must contain a certain number of cookies. Since there are 14 bags, we can write an equation:
28 = 14x
Where x is the number of cookies in each bag. Now, we also know that there are 86 candies in total, so let's add this information to our equation:
28 + 86 = 14x
Now we need to solve for x (the number of cookies in each bag). To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14:
28 / 14 = x
x = 20
So, if you have 28 cookies and 86 candies in total, you have 14 bags of cookies, each containing 20 cookies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is14.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the number of girls is 458 more than the number of boys, so we can write an equation like this: Number of girls = Number of boys + 458. Now, we also know that there are 692 girls in total. So, we can set up another equation: Total number of pupils = Number of girls. Substituting the value of 692 from the second equation into the first one, we get: Number of girls = Total number of pupils - Number of boys + 458. Solving for Number of boys, we find out that there are 133 boys in the school. Therefore, there are 692 + 133 = 825 pupils in the school altogether.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the book has 3 chapters and each chapter has the same number of pages. So, if there are x pages in each chapter, we can write an equation:
x + x + x = 594 ... (1)
Since it took Frank 607 days to finish the book, we can also write an equation for the time taken to read the book:
607 = x / 3 ... (2)
Now, let's solve both equations simultaneously. Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
2x + x + x = 594
Simplifying, we get:
3x = 594
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 198
So, each chapter has approximately 198 pages. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is198.

Q: Nell collects cards. She had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Nell started with 214 Ace cards and 246 baseball cards, for a total of 460 cards. Then she gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced the number of cards she had. So, after giving some to Jeff, Nell had 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards. To find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of Ace cards:
495 - 404 = 91
So, Nell has 91 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 24 classrooms. There are 120 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. There are 84 seats on each school bus. How many students are in each class?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 24 classrooms, and since each classroom has the same number of students as all other classrooms, we can say that there are x students in each classroom. Since there are 120 students in the whole school, we can set up an equation:
x + x + ... + x = 120 (where x represents the number of students in each class)
Now, let's find out how many students fit on each school bus. We know that there are 84 seats on each bus, so if we divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus, we get:
Number of students / Number of seats per bus = 120 / 84 = 1.45
Since you cannot have a fraction of a student, we must round this value to the nearest whole number. So, there are approximately 1.5 students in each class. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is15.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the frog jumped 33 inches more than the grasshopper. So, if the grasshopper jumped x inches, then the frog jumped x + 33 inches. Now we are told that the mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog. So, the mouse jumped (x + 33) - 5 = ?
Solution: To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance the mouse jumped from the distance the frog jumped. Since the frog jumped x + 33 inches and the mouse jumped (x + 33) - 5 inches, the difference between their jumps is:
(x + 33) - (x + 33 - 5) = ?
Simplifying this equation gives us:

So, Zachary did 40 exercises (push-ups + crunches), David did 93 push-ups and 56 crunches. To find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did, we can subtract the number of crunches David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 93 - 56 = 37.
Therefore, Zachary did 37 more push-ups than crunches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is37

Q: 5 red peaches and 11 green peaches are in the basket. How many more green peaches than red peaches are in the basket?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 5 red peaches and 11 green peaches in the basket. So, we can write this as a ratio:
Red peaches: Green peaches = 5 : 11
Now, we want to find out how many more green peaches than red peaches are in the basket. To do this, we subtract the number of red peaches from the number of green peaches:
Number of green peaches - Number of red peaches = 11 - 5 = 6
So, there are 6 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Q: Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 7 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 22 marbles How many marbles does Doug have now?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Ed has 22 marbles and he had 6 more than Doug, so Ed has 22 + 6 = 28 marbles. Now, we are told that Doug lost 7 of his marbles at the playground. So, if Doug had x marbles before, he will have x - 7 = 3x marbles after losing 7 marbles. Since Ed has 28 marbles and Doug has 3x marbles, we can set up a proportion: 28 / 3x = 22 / x. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, Doug has 14 marbles left after losing 7 marbles at the playground. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is14 .

Q: If Lewis earns $ 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season. How much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?
A: Let's think step by step.
Lewis earns $ 1357 per week, so in one week, he earns:
$$ = 1357 \times 1 = 1357 $$
Now, let's find out how many weeks he works in 73 harvest seasons:
$$ = 73 \div 223 = 0.33 $$
So, Lewis works for 33 weeks in 73 harvest seasons.
Now, we can calculate his total income:
Total income = Weekly income x Number of weeks worked
= $ 1357 \times 33 = $ 43,611
Therefore, Lewis will earn $ 43,611 if he works for 73 harvest seasons.

Q: Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Paige had 16 goldfish initially, and then 71 catfish were added to the pond. However, we are told that stray cats ate some of the fish, so let's assume that 39 goldfish (16 - 42) and 40 catfish (71 - 31) disappeared. Therefore, Paige now has 8 goldfish and 31 catfish in her pond. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

Q: Baker made 43 cakes and 114 pastries. If he sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes How many more pastries than cakes did baker sell?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of pastries and cakes are equal, so we can write an equation:
Pastries + Cakes = Total
We also know that the number of pastries is 114 plus the number of cakes which is 43, so we can rewrite the equation as follows:
114 + 43 = Total
Now let's find out how many pastries were sold if there were 154 pastries in total. So, we subtract the number of pastries Baker made (114) from the total number of pastries:
154 - 114 = 40
So, Baker sold 40 more pastries than cakes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is40 .

Q: Each pack of dvds costs 107 dollars. If there is a discount of 106 dollars on each pack How many packs of dvds can you buy with 93 dollars?
A: Let's think step by step.The cost of one pack of DVDs is $107, and the discount is $106. So, after applying the discount, the new price of one pack of DVDs becomes:
$107 - $106 = $1
So, if we want to know how many packs of DVDs we can buy with $93, we need to divide $93 by the new price of one pack of DVDs, which is $1:
$93 / $1 = 93 packs of DVDs
Therefore, you can buy 93 packs of DVDs with $93 using the given discount. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is93.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the length of Jesse's room is 12 feet, which means we can write this as 12.
We also know that the width of Jesse's room is 11 feet, which means we can write this as 11.
Now, to find out how much longer Jesse's room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, let's do that:
12 - 11 = 1
So, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1.

A: Let's think step by step.If Matthew has 15 crackers, he gives an equal number (15/5 = 3) to each of his 5 friends. So now, Matthew has 10 crackers left. To find out how many crackers each friend ate, we can divide the number of crackers Matthew had before giving them to his friends by the number of friends he gave them to: 10 crackers / 5 friends = 2 crackers per friend. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Q: A book has 2 chapters. The first chapter is 48 pages long. The second chapter is 11 pages long. How many more pages does the first chapter have than the second chapter?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, we can write an equation:
Total pages = Chapter 1 pages + Chapter 2 pages
Now, we know that the number of pages in Chapter 1 is 48 and the number of pages in Chapter 2 is 11. So, we can substitute these values into our equation:
Total pages = 48 + 11
Total pages = 59
Therefore, the first chapter has 11 more pages than the second chapter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is11.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Allan had 2 balloons initially, and he bought 3 more later. So, Allan has 5 balloons now (2 + 3).
Jake had 6 balloons initially, so Jake has more balloons than Allan. By how much? Well, we can subtract the number of balloons Allan has from the number of balloons Jake had: 6 - 5 = 1.
So, Jake has one more balloon than Allan in the park. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 67 sacks per day and that each sack containes 12 oranges. How many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges?
A: Let's think step by step.If they harvest 67 sacks per day, and there are 12 oranges in each sack, then the total number of oranges harvested per day is:
67 sacks/day x 12 oranges/sack = 804 oranges/day
Now, let's find out how many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges:
Total number of oranges = Number of sacks x Number of oranges/sack
= 35 sacks x 12 oranges/sack
= 420 oranges
Therefore, if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges, they will have harvested 420 oranges. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 106 per t-shirt sold, so if they sold x t-shirts during the Arkansas game, they made $ 106x . Since they also sold 242 t-shirts in total, we can set up the equation:
$ 106x = 115 + 242 - 106
Solving for x , we get:
x = 137
So, they sold 137 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. To find out how many they sold during the Texas Tech game, we can use the same reasoning:
Let's say they sold y t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. Then, their total revenue from both games is:
Total Revenue = $ 106x + $ 106y
We know that the total number of t-shirts sold is 242, so we can set up the equation:
x + y = 242
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

Now, we know that Randy used 63 blocks to build the tower, so we can say that the number of blocks left after building the tower is equal to the total number of blocks he had minus the number of blocks used for the tower. So, let's write another equation:
Total blocks = 1 - 63 = -62
Now, we want to find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than he did to build the tower. To do this, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. So, let's solve the two equations simultaneously:
-62 = 89 - 63
Solving for the difference, we get:
Difference = 26
Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the number of visitors on the day in question is 705. The number of visitors on the previous day was 191, and the number of visitors on the day before that was 457. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Number of visitors on current day = 705
Number of visitors on previous day = 191
Number of visitors on day before that = 457
Now we need to find out how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days. To do this, we will subtract the number of visitors on each of those days from the number of visitors on the current day:
More visitors on current day = Number of visitors on current day - (Number of visitors on previous day + Number of visitors on day before that)
= 705 - (191 + 457)
= 705 - 648
= 57
So, there were 57 more visitors at the Buckingham palace on that day compared to the previous 245 days.

Number of red peaches + Number of green peaches = Total number of peaches (12)
We also know that each basket has 4 red peaches, so the number of red peaches in one basket is 4. Now, let's find out how many green peaches are in each basket:
Number of green peaches in one basket = Total number of peaches - Number of red peaches (4)
So, if there are 2 baskets, then the number of green peaches in each basket is:
Number of green peaches in each basket = 12 - 8 (since there are 8 red peaches in both baskets)
= 4 green peaches in each basket

Q: Melissa played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points scoring the same for each game. How many points did she score in each game?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Melissa scored a total of 81 points playing 3 games, so we can write an equation:
Total points = Points per game x Number of games
We are given that Melissa scored the same number of points (81) for each game, so we can simplify the equation to:
Points per game = Total points / Number of games
Now we have two equations:
Points per game = 81 / 3
Points per game = ?
Q: What is the value of k in the equation 2k + 5 = 17?
A: To solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable "k". We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

2k = 12
Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us the answer:
k = 6

Q: In a school there are 315 girls and 309 boys. There are also 772 teachers How many people are there in that school?
A: Let's think step by step.We know the number of girls is 315, so we can start with them. The total number of girls = 315. Now let's find out how many boys there are. The number of boys is 309, so we add this to our total number of students. Total number of students = 315 + 309 = 624. Finally, we need to add the number of teachers to get the total number of people in the school. Number of teachers = 772, so we add it to our total. Total number of people in the school = 624 + 772 = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 people in that school.

City B: (70°F × 9/5) = 32.22°C
City C: (80°F × 9/5) = 32.81°C
Now, let's add up all the temperatures and divide by 3:
(27.78 + 32.22 + 32.81) / 3 = 29.65°C
So, the average temperature of the three cities is 29.65°C.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of cakes Baker made is equal to the number of cakes he sold plus the number of cakes he still has. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Number of cakes Baker made = Number of cakes sold + Number of cakes still available
In this case, Baker sold 145 cakes and still has 72 cakes left, so we can plug these values into our equation:
Number of cakes Baker made = 145 + 72
Number of cakes Baker made = 217
Therefore, Baker made 217 cakes in total.

Number of red peaches = 4
Number of green peaches = 6
Now, let's divide the total number of peaches (10) among the baskets:
Basket 1: 4 red peaches + 6 green peaches = 10
Basket 2: 4 red peaches + 6 green peaches = 10
...
So, if there are X baskets, then:
X x 4 = 40 (red peaches)
X x 6 = 60 (green peaches)
Solving for X, we get:
X = 8
Therefore, there are 8 baskets of peaches.

Q: Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning. He then received 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. How many more letters did Jack receive in the morning than in the afternoon?
A: Let's think step by step.In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. So he received a total of 14 pieces of mail (emails + letters).
In the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters. So he received a total of 9 pieces of mail (emails + letters) in the afternoon.
To find out how many more letters Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we can subtract the number of letters he received in the afternoon from the number of letters he received in the morning:
14 - 9 = 5
So Jack received 5 more letters in the morning than in the afternoon.

Q: Randy has 97 blocks. He uses some blocks to build a tower. If there are 72 blocks left How many blocks did he use to build the tower?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Randy had 97 blocks in total, and he used some of them to build a tower. So, we can say that he has 72 blocks left after building the tower. To find out how many blocks he used for the tower, we can divide the number of blocks he has left (72) by the total number of blocks he had (97):
Number of blocks used = Number of blocks left / Total number of blocks
= 72 / 97

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount of flour needed is 6 cups, and Mary has already added x cups. So, we can write an equation:
6 = x + 8
Now, we know that the total amount of sugar needed is 13 cups, and Mary has already added y cups. So, we can write another equation:
13 = y
We want to find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, so we solve both equations simultaneously:
x + 8 = 6 (first equation)
y = 13 - (second equation)
Now, we can substitute the value of y from the second equation into the first equation:
x + 8 = 6 (first equation)
Substituting y = 7:
x + 8 = 6
x = 2
So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of flour to the recipe.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $ 51 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the game at regular price. We can do this by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold by the original price of $51 per t-shirt:
Number of t-shirts sold = 130 t-shirts x $51/t-shirt = $6,430
Next, we need to calculate the amount of money that was made from the discounted sales. To do this, we subtract the discount amount ($8 per t-shirt) from the regular price of each t-shirt:
Discounted price = $51/t-shirt - $8/t-shirt = $43/t-shirt
Now, let's multiply the number of t-shirts sold during the game at the discounted price to find out how much money was made from those sales:
Money made from discounted sales = Number of t-shirts sold x Discounted price = 130 t-shirts x $43/t-shirt = $5,470 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Randy had x blocks at the start, and he used them all up to build his tower. After building the tower, he had y blocks left (y = 38). So we can set up an equation:
x + y = 52 ...(1)
We also know that x is equal to the number of blocks Randy had at the start. Therefore, we can substitute x for y in equation (1):
x + y = 52
Substituting x for y:
x + x = 52
Simplifying:
2x = 52
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 26

Q: Paul got a box of 601 crayons and 406 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 336 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Paul started with 601 crayons and 406 erasers, so together they added up to 1007 items (601 + 406 = 1007). Then we are told that at the end of the school year, Paul had 336 crayons left. This means that he must have lost some crayons during the school year. Let's assume that he lost x crayons. Since he didn't lose any erasers, the number of erasers he had left is still 406. So, the total number of items Paul had left at the end of the school year is:
1007 - x - 406 = 336
Now we can solve for x by subtracting 406 from both sides of the equation:
1007 - x = 336
x = 261
So, Paul had 261 more erasers than crayons left at the end of the school year. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is261.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Baker made a total of 144 cakes and sold 71 of them, so the number of cakes he has left is:
144 - 71 = 73
Now we are told that Baker made 111 more cakes, so the total number of cakes he has now is:

Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together. If he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g Total how many grams of wax do the feathers require?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount of wax required for all the feathers is 17g, since we have already determined this in a previous question. So, if our bird currently has 557g of wax, then it must be using some of that wax to stick the first set of feathers together. How much does it use? Well, let's divide the total amount of wax needed (17g) by the number of sets of feathers it needs to stick together (4). That gives us the amount of wax used per set of feathers: 17g / 4 = 4.25g. Since there are 4 sets of feathers in total, the bird uses 4.25g of wax per set of feathers. Therefore, the total amount of wax required for all the feathers is 4.25 x 4 = 17g. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is17g

Q: In Haley's class some boys love to play marbles. If Haley has 10 marbles and she gave 5 marbles to each boy How many boys did she give the marbles to?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 3 boys in total who like playing marbles, so we can write this as a number sentence: 3 x = 10 (where x is the number of marbles given to each boy). Since Haley gave 5 marbles to each boy, we can substitute this value into our equation: 3x = 10. Now we need to solve for x, which means dividing both sides of the equation by 3: x = 10 / 3 = 3. So, Haley gave 3 marbles to each of the 3 boys who like playing marbles. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room, and later he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, if we add both amounts together, we get: Total number of action figures = Initial number of action figures + Number of new action figures. In this case, the initial number of action figures is 3 (since Jerry already had 3 action figures on the shelf), and the number of new action figures is 7. Therefore, the total number of action figures on Jerry's shelf is 3 + 7 = 10. So, Jerry had 3 action figures initially on the shelf.

Q: Some campers went rowing in the morning while 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 60 campers went rowing that day How many campers went rowing in the morning?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that some campers went rowing in the morning and 7 more campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.
Given information: Total number of campers who went rowing = 60.
So, we can write an equation:
Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 60
Now, let's solve for the number of campers who went rowing in the morning:
Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 60 - 7 (number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon)
Substitute the value of 7 as the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon:
Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 60 - 7 = 53
Therefore, 53 campers went rowing in the morning.

3x = 20 - 5
3x = 15
Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:
x = 15 / 3

Q: 53 campers went rowing in the morning 48 campers went rowing in the afternoon and 49 campers went rowing in the evening. How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the evening?
A: Let's think step by step.In total, we know that 140 campers (53 + 48 + 49) went rowing altogether. So if there are more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the evening, then the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and those who went rowing in the evening is positive.
Let X be the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and Y be the number of campers who went rowing in the evening. We can write an equation based on the information given:
X + Y = 140 ... (1)
We also know that X > Y because there were more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the evening. So, we can write another equation:
X - Y > 0 ... (2)
Now, let's solve for X - Y. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:
X - Y = 70
So, there were 70 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the evening.

Q: Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends How many cakes did each person eat?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his two friends. So, if he gave x crackers to one friend, he also gave x cakes to that friend. And if he gave y crackers to the other friend, he also gave y cakes to that friend.
Now, we can use the information given in the problem to find out how many cakes each friend ate. Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to both friends, we can say that the total number of crackers given is twice the number of crackers given to one friend. That means the number of crackers given to one friend is half the total number of crackers given. Similarly, the number of cakes given to one friend is also half the total number of cakes given.
So, let's solve for x and y using the information provided in the problem:
x + y = 29 (total number of crackers)
x = 14 (since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers to both friends)
y = 15 (since Matthew gave an equal number of cakes to both friends)
Therefore, each friend ate 14 c

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Frank finished the book in 664 days, and there are 2 chapters in the book. So, we can calculate the number of days it took him to read one chapter as follows:
664 days / 2 chapters = x days/chapter
Now, we need to divide the total number of pages (810 pages) by the number of chapters he read per day:
810 pages / x chapters/day = y pages/day
Since Frank read the entire book, we know that x + y = 2, where x is the number of days it took him to read one chapter and y is the number of pages he read per day.
Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 33 days/chapter
y = 810 pages/day
So, Frank read 33 days per chapter and 810 pages per day on average.

Q: Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Nell initially had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, for a total of 665 cards. Then she gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced the number of cards she had. So, if we subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from the initial total, we get the new total number of cards Nell has:
665 - (some number) = 415
Since we are told that Nell has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left, we can set up an equation using this information:
Baseball cards = 415
Ace cards = ?
Now, we need to solve for the value of Ace cards. To do this, we can divide the number of baseball cards by the number of Ace cards:
Ace cards = Baseball cards / 415
So, if Nell has 415 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, then she has 782 Ace cards left (since 415 / 356 = 782). Therefore, Nell has 782 more Ace cards than baseball cards. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is782.

Q: A book has 3 chapters. The first chapter is 35 pages long the second chapter is 18 pages long and the third chapter is 3 pages long. How many more pages does the second chapter have than the third chapter?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the pages in each chapter. So, we can write an equation:
Total Pages = Chapter 1 + Chapter 2 + Chapter 3
Now, let's find out how many pages are in each chapter:
Chapter 1: 35 pages
Chapter 2: 18 pages
Chapter 3: 3 pages
So, we can substitute these values into our equation:
Total Pages = 35 + 18 + 3
Total Pages = 60
Now, we want to find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the third chapter. To do this, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:
Number of More Pages = Total Pages - Number of Pages in Chapter 3
= 60 - 3
= 57
Therefore, the second chapter has 57 more pages than the third chapter.

Q: In a school there are 402 more girls than boys. If there are 739 girls How many boys are there in that school?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the number of girls is 402 more than the number of boys, so we can write an equation as follows: Number of girls = Number of boys + 402. Now, we have been given that there are 739 girls in the school. So, if we substitute this value into our equation, we get: Number of girls = Number of boys + 402 = 739. Solving for the number of boys, we find that there are 337 boys in the school. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is337.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the frog jumped x inches more than the grasshopper. So, if the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, then the frog jumped x + 19 = 39 inches. Now we can find out how far the mouse jumped by subtracting its distance from the frog's distance: Mouse jumped x + 19 - 39 = -20 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the mouse jumped 49 inches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is49.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie, so if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 3 apples. Since Adam has 9 apples, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 3) = 9. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 3 = 9. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us: 2x = 6. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 3. So Jackie has 3 apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. If 144 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 467 suggested adding bacon to the menu and 79 suggested adding tomatoes How many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested tomatoes?
A: Let's think step by step.We know from the problem statement that a total of 144 students were surveyed, and they suggested different types of food for the school cafeteria. Specifically, we are told that:
* 467 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
* 79 students suggested adding tomatoes.
Now, let's find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested tomatoes. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. So, if we subtract 79 (the number of students who suggested tomatoes) from 467 (the number of students who suggested bacon), we get:
467 - 79 = 388
So, there are 388 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested tomatoes.

Q: There are some baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches. If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets How many baskets of peaches are there?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that each basket has 4 red peaches, so the total number of red peaches is 4 x (number of baskets). Similarly, we know that each basket has 3 green peaches, so the total number of green peaches is 3 x (number of baskets). Now, we have to find out how many baskets there are in total. To do this, we can use the information given in the problem: "There are a total of 7 peaches." So, we can set up an equation using this information: 4x + 3 = 7. Solving for x, we get x = 2. Therefore, there are 2 baskets of peaches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 192 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 34 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total revenue from selling t-shirts is equal to the number of t-shirts sold times the price per t-shirt, which is $ 192. Similarly, we can calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys as the number of jerseys sold times the price per jersey, which is also $ 34. Now let's find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. According to the problem statement, 157 t-shirts were sold. So now we have two equations: Number of t-shirts = Total revenue / Price per t-shirt Number of jerseys = Total revenue / Price per jersey Substituting the values given in the problem into these equations, we get: Number of t-shirts = 157 x $ 192 Number of jerseys = 157 x $ 34 Solving for the difference between the prices of t-shirts and jerseys, we get: Difference = $ 192 - $ 3

Red peaches + Yellow peaches + Green peaches = Total number of peaches
From the problem statement, we know that there are 7 red peaches, 71 yellow peaches, and 8 green peaches in the basket. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation as follows:
7 + 71 + 8 = x (where x is the total number of peaches)
Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do that?

Q: A book has 2 chapters across 81 pages. The second chapter is 68 pages long. How many pages are in the second chapter?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 2 chapters in total, and each chapter has a certain number of pages. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
In this case, the total number of pages is 81 (since there are 81 pages in the book), and the number of chapters is 2. Therefore, we can solve for the number of pages in Chapter 1 as follows:
Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 81 / 2 = 40.5 pages
Now, let's find out how many pages are in the second chapter. Since the second chapter is 68 pages long, we can say that it occupies a fraction of the total number of pages in the book. In other words, the number of pages in the second chapter is equal to the remaining number of pages after subtracting the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages.
So, if we have 81 pages in total, and the first chapter takes up 40.5 pages, then the remaining number of pages is:
Remaining pages = 81 - 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

Therefore, the total amount of money made from both t-shirts and jerseys can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = $62x + $99y. Now we have two equations: $62x + $99y = 183 (from t-shirts) $62x + $99y = 31 (from jerseys). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: x = 105 and y = 74. So, the Razorback shop made a total of $62 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6200.

Q: Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Lewis gets paid $ 491 per week for 1181 weeks, which is equal to $ 573,000. Now we need to calculate how much he pays in rent each week. According to the question, Lewis pays $ 216 per week in rent. Therefore, the total amount he pays in rent over 1181 weeks is $ 216 x 1181 = $ 250,000. So, after paying rent, Lewis has $ 573,000 - $ 250,000 = $ 323,000 left.

Then we are told that after selling some of these items in a garage sale, he was left with 82 books and 14 pens. This means that he sold a total of 75 items (books + pens) at the garage sale. To find out how many pens he sold, we can divide the number of pens he had left after the garage sale by the total number of pens he sold: 14 / 75 = 0.19 or 19 pens.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
A: Let's think step by step.The total number of planks needed for the walls is 12 + 10 = 22 planks. Since large planks require 15 nails, we can calculate the number of nails required for each large plank as follows:
Number of nails per large plank = Total number of nails / Number of large planks
= 15 / 12
= 1 nail per large plank
Now, since there are 10 small planks, we can calculate the number of nails required for each small plank as follows:
Number of nails per small plank = Total number of nails / Number of small planks
= 15 / 10
= 1.5 nails per small plank
So, in total, John needs 22 x 1 = 22 nails for the house walls. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is22.

Q: Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into 4 groups. Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. How many eggs will each group have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of eggs is 8, so we can divide it by 4 to find out how many eggs each group will have.
So, if we divide 8 by 4, we get 2. That means each group will have 2 eggs.
Q: Can you explain why your answer is correct?
A: Of course! To figure out how many eggs each group will have, we need to divide the total number of eggs (which is 8) by the number of groups we want to make (which is 4). When we do this, we get 2 eggs per group. This makes sense because if we have 4 groups and each group has 2 eggs, then all together we have 8 eggs. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

A: Let's think step by step.If Baker made 121 cakes, he must have had some left over after selling 105 of them. So the number of cakes he has now is equal to 121 - 105 = 16. Then, when he bought 170 new cakes, he added that amount to what he already had, so now he has 16 + 170 = 186 cakes. Therefore, Baker still has 186 cakes.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 98 per t-shirt sold, so if they sell x t-shirts during the Arkansas game, they will make $ 98x dollars. Since we are told that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we can set up the equation:
$ 98x = 89(98)
Simplifying this equation gives us:
$ 952 = 89(98)
Now we divide both sides of the equation by 89 to get:
$ 10.74 = (98)
So the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 10.74 per t-shirt sold during the Arkansas game.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Debby has 180 water bottles, which means she will have x number of water bottles left after drinking 15 bottles per day for y days. Since we also know how many soda bottles Debby had (95), we can set up an equation to represent this situation:
x = 180 - 15y
Now we need to solve for y, or the number of days it takes for Debby to finish all 180 water bottles. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 15:
y = x / 15
So, if Debby has 180 water bottles and drinks 15 bottles per day, she will finish them in 12 days (180 / 15 = 12).

Pages = Number of Books x Pages per Book
We know that there are 249 pages in each book, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
Pages = 3 x 249
Now we need to solve for "pages" which means we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
Pages / 3 = 249

A: Let's think step by step.We know that a total of 1,520,820 kids (644997 + 893835) stayed at home or went to camp during the summer break. Since only 893835 kids went to camp, we can deduce that 644997 kids stayed at home. So, the number of kids who stayed at home is equal to 644997.
Now, let's find out how many kids are in Lawrence County. The problem states that 78 kids from outside the county attended the camp. If we subtract these kids from the total number of kids who stayed at home, we get the number of kids in Lawrence County. Therefore, the answer is:
Number of kids in Lawrence County = Total number of kids - Number of kids from outside the county who attended camp

Q: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
A: Let's think step by step.Since there are 28 friends, if Matthew gives an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, then the total number of crackers given is 28 x 13 = 340. Similarly, the total number of cakes given is 28 x 15 = 420. Now, since each person ate an equal amount of both crackers and cakes, we can find out how much each person ate by dividing the total number of crackers or cakes they received by the number of people. So, for crackers, 340 / 28 = 12; and for cakes, 420 / 28 = 15. Therefore, each person ate 12 crackers and 15 cakes.

Q: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 231 raisin cookies and 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cakes did Helen bake?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday, so let's call that x. Then she baked 231 raisin cookies today, which is more than x because we said there were more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies. So, if x is how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday, then the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today is x + 231 = 250 (since she baked a total of 237 chocolate chip cookies). Now, we can see that the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies and the number of raisin cookies is:
x + 231 - 237 = 0
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4
So, Helen baked 4 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cakes! 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of books is 34, and since they are distributed equally among two shelves, we can say that each shelf contains half of the books. So, if x is the number of books in each shelf, then we can write an equation:
x + x = 34 ... (1)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 34 / 2 = 17
So, there are 17 books in each bookshelf.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Bobby started with 22 pieces of candy. After he ate some, he had 8 pieces left. So, we can say that he ate x pieces of candy to start with, where x is the number of pieces he ate before he ate the additional 5 pieces.
Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy Bobby ate initially. Since he ate 5 more pieces after having 8 pieces left, we can set up the equation:
x + 5 = 8
Solving for x, we get:
x = 3
So, Bobby ate 3 pieces of candy at the start.

Q: There are 466 pots. Each pot has 53 flowers and 181 sticks in it. How many flowers and sticks are there in all?
A: Let's think step by step.If we have x pots, then the total number of flowers is 466x. And if we have y pots, then the total number of sticks is 181y. So, we can write an equation:
466x + 181y = 7920 (total number of flowers and sticks)
Now, we need to solve for x and y. We know that x + y = 466 (since there are 466 pots). Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:
466x + 181(466 - x) = 7920
Simplifying this equation, we get:
466x + 8496 = 7920
Subtracting 466x from both sides gives us:
8496 = 3074
Dividing both sides by 8496 gives us:
x = 3074 / 8496 = 1/2
So, there are 3074 pots with 53 flowers each, or

A: Let's think step by step.We know that 35 bird families flew away to Asia, so we can write this down as 35 birds x family = total number of birds flying away to Asia. Similarly, we know that 62 bird families flew away to Africa, so we can write this down as 62 birds x family = total number of birds flying away to Africa. Now, let's find out how many more birds flew away to Africa than to Asia: Total number of birds flying away to Africa - Total number of birds flying away to Asia = 62 - 35 = 27.

Since he only gives 2 junk mails to each house, the total number of junk mails he needs to give is 28x (since 2 x 2 = 4). So, we can set up an equation: 14x = 28x. Solving for x, we get x = 2. Therefore, there are 2 houses in a block. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Q: What is the value of x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20?
A: To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
3x = 20 - 5
3x = 15
Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 3 gives us the answer:
x = 15 / 3

A: Let's think step by step.We know the total number of customers was 11 initially, and then some left, leaving 3 customers behind. To find out how many more customers left than those who stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of customers who remained from the initial total. So, the answer is:

A: Let's think step by step.If the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day, then the total amount of money it made over 5 days is equal to 5 times the daily income. So we can set up an equation like this:
$165 = 5x

A: Let's think step by step.We know that everyday, Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese and some additional hours on learning English. So the total time he spends on learning both languages is 5 + x, where x is the number of hours he spends on learning English.
We are also given that he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, so we can write an equation based on this information:
x = 5 + 2
Now we need to solve for x, which means we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
x - 5 = 2

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how much one t-shirt costs before and after the increase in price. We know that the original price of a t-shirt is $ 201, so let's call it x. After the increase in price, the new price becomes $ 217 + x = 358. Now, we want to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. Since you said there were 14 t-shirts sold, we can write this as 14. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold by their pre-increase price: $$ Total = Number \times Price = 14 \times (x) = 14(201)$$Now we have three variables: x (the original price), y (the new price after the increase), and z (the number of t-shirts sold).

Now, let's check how much sugar Mary needs to add: 6 cups of sugar minus the amount of sugar she has already added (5 cups) gives us the remaining amount: 6 - 5 = 1 cup. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup of sugar more. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1.

Q: There are 3941 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4950 erasers. If the erasers are organized into 495 groups How big is each group?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's Skittles collection and 4950 erasers. Since we want to organize them into groups, let's assume that we can divide both collections equally into groups.
So, if we divide the Skittles into groups of size x, then the number of Skittles in each group will be 3941 / x. Similarly, if we divide the erasers into groups of size y, then the number of erasers in each group will be 4950 / y.
Now, since Steven wants to organize the erasers into 495 groups, we need to find out what value of y satisfies this equation:
495 = 4950 / y
Solving for y, we get:
y = 4950 / 495 = 10
So, each group contains 10 erasers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 11 different books in the "crazy silly school" series, and we have read 13 of them. This means that there are 8 books left to read (11 - 13 = 8).
Now, let's find out how many movies there are in total in the series. According to the question, there are 63 movies in the series. Since we have watched 63 movies, this means that there are X movies left to watch (63 - 6 = X), where X is the number of movies that we haven't watched yet.
Since we have read 13 books, we can deduce that there are Y movies left to watch for each book that we haven't read (X = Y \* 13), where Y is a constant. Therefore, the answer is:
Y = 5
So, there are 5 more movies than books in the "crazy silly school" series.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they made $ 230 by selling t-shirts. How many t-shirts did they sell?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold, so if we multiply this amount by the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, we will get the total revenue generated by the sale of those t-shirts. So, let's write an equation based on this information:
Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt
Now, we are given that the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 230 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. If we substitute this value into our equation, we get:
$ 230 = Number of t-shirts x $ 23
To solve for the number of t-shirts, we can divide both sides of the equation by the price per t-shirt:
Number of t-shirts = $ 230 / $ 23
Number of t-shirts = 10
So, the Razorback t-shirt shop sold 10 t-shirts 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that out of 450 students, 127 (45% of 450) chose mashed potatoes as their preferred option. Therefore, we can assume that 450 - 127 = 323 students did not choose mashed potatoes. Now, let's find out how many students suggested other options. Since 38 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, we can say that 38 is equal to x, where x represents the number of students who suggested other options. So, we have:
x + 323 = 450 ...(1)
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract equation (1) from both sides:
x + 323 = 450
Subtracting 323 from both sides gives us:
x = 97
Therefore, 97 students suggested other options besides mashed potatoes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

4 = 2x
Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:
2 = x
So, John needs 1 plank for every 2 nails he uses. Since he will use 4 nails, John needs a total of 2 planks (since 2 divided by 2 is equal to 1). Therefore, John needs 2 planks for the house wall. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

A: Let's think step by step.If Paco had 6 cookies, then after giving some to his friend, he had x fewer cookies. We know that the total number of cookies Paco gave away is 30 (including the ones he ate). So, we can set up an equation:
x = 30 - 23
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
So, Paco gave 7 more cookies to his friend than he ate. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 36 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 35 old ones. Now he has 22 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Danny had 35 old bottle caps before he went to the park, and then he found 36 new ones there. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny collected is 36 + 35 = 71.
Now we need to find out how many more bottle caps Danny found at the park than he threw away. To do this, we subtract the number of bottle caps he threw away (35) from the total number of bottle caps he collected (71):
71 - 35 = 36
So, Danny found 36 more bottle caps at the park than he threw away.

A: Let's think step by step.The chef started with 40 apples. He made some pies using both apples and peaches. After making the pies, he had 39 apples left. This means that he used some of his apples to make the pies. So, we can say that he used x apples to make the pies (where x is a number). Now, we know that he has 39 apples left after making the pies, so we can write an equation: 40 - x = 39. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, the chef used 10 apples to make the pies.

Q: After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at 12 feet How deep was the water?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Ron stands at 12 feet, and Dean is 11 feet shorter than him. So, Dean stands at 12 - 11 = 1 foot tall. Now, we need to find out how many times 1 foot is equal to the depth of the water. Since the depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height, it means it is also 5 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 5 x 1 = 5 feet. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5 feet.

Q: If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet How far is the end of the cave?
A: Let's think step by step.The distance from the entrance to the bottom of the cave is 919 feet, as you mentioned. To find out how far it is from the bottom of the cave to the end, we need to add the total length of the tunnel that needs to be traveled (1307 feet) to the depth of the cave. So, the answer is:
End of the cave = Depth of the cave + Total length of the tunnel = 919 ft + 1307 ft = 2226 ft
Therefore, the end of the cave is approximately 2226 feet away from the entrance.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 19 + x marbles and Doug had x marbles. When Ed lost some marbles at the playground, he had fewer marbles than before. So, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, which means that Ed has 19 + x - 8 = x + 11 marbles. Since Ed had more marbles than Doug initially, we can say that Ed lost 11 marbles at the playground.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so Dean is 6 feet tall (since 8 - 6 = 2). Now we can use the fact that the depth of the water is twice Dean's height to find out how deep the water is. So if Dean is 6 feet tall and the depth of the water is twice his height, then the depth of the water is 12 feet (since 2 x 6 = 12). Therefore, the water was 12 feet deep.

Q: Jake has 8 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than Steven. Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches. How many more peaches than apples does Steven have?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so the number of peaches Jake has is equal to the number of peaches Steven has minus 8.
We also know that Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so the number of apples Jake has is equal to the number of apples Steven has plus 10.
So, if we let S be the number of peaches Steven has and A be the number of apples Jake has, we can set up the equation:
S - 8 = A + 10
Now we need to solve for S (the number of peaches Steven has). To do this, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
S = A + 10 - 8
Simplifying, we get:
S = A + 2
Now we know that Steven has 2 more peaches than apples. So, if he has x apples, he has x + 2 peaches.

Total number of emails = 6 + X (where X is the number of emails received in the evening)
So, we can set up an equation:
6 + X = 10 ...(1)
Now, we are given that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon. Substituting this value into equation (1), we get:
6 + 3 = 10
Solving for X, we get:

Q: Paul had 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 113 books and 19 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Paul started with 42 pens, so if he sold some pens at the garage sale, we can subtract that number from his original total to find out how many pens he has left. So, let's start by subtracting the number of pens he sold from his original total:
42 (original) - x (pens sold) = 19 (left after garage sale)
Now, we need to solve for "x" (the number of pens sold). To do this, we can divide the number of pens he has left after the garage sale by the number of pens he originally had:
19 / 42 = x
So, Paul sold 20 pens at the garage sale! 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is20.

Q: Robin's hair was 14 inches long. It grew by 8 inches. Then he cut off 20 inches. How long is his hair now?
A: Let's think step by step.If Robin's hair was originally 14 inches long, and it grew by 8 inches, then the new length of his hair would be:
14 + 8 = 22 inches
Now, if he cut off 20 inches, we need to subtract that amount from the new length:
22 - 20 = 2 inches
So, Robin's hair is currently 2 inches long. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 18 bird families living near the mountain. If 38 bird families flew away to africa and 80 bird families flew away to asia How many bird families flew away for the winter?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that 38 bird families flew away to Africa, so we can subtract this number from the total number of bird families living near the mountain. The remaining birds are 18 - 38 = 10 bird families. Similarly, we know that 80 bird families flew away to Asia, so we can subtract this number from the total number of bird families living near the mountain again. The remaining birds are 10 - 80 = 70 bird families. Therefore, there were 70 bird families that flew away for the winter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 70 .

Q: Rachel has 52 apple trees. She picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Rachel had 52 apple trees, and she picked 2 apples from one of them. That means there are 50 trees left. And now we know that one of those trees has 7 apples remaining. So, if the tree had 50 trees, each tree would have 7 apples initially. Therefore, the answer is 350 apples (50 trees x 7 apples/tree). 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is350.

Q: There are 16 different books and 14 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 19 of the books and watched 13 of the movies How many more books than movies are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?
A: Let's think step by step.We know that there are 16 books in the series, so if we have read 19, then we have not read 7 books (16 - 19 = 7). Now, let's find out how many movies we have watched. According to the question, we have watched 13 movies, which means that there are 14 movies left (14 - 13 = 1). Therefore, there are 7 more books than movies in the 'crazy silly school' series (7 - 1 = 6). 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.
