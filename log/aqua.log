Q: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
A: Let's think step by step.We know that 20% of the students took Physics, so the number of students who did not take Physics is 80% of the total number of students. Similarly, we know that 28% of the students took Math, so the number of students who did not take Math is 72% of the total number of students. Now, we need to find the least possible number of students in the school. Let X be the total number of students in the school. Then, the number of students who took Physics is 20/100X, and the number of students who took Math is 28/100X. Since both numbers must add up to 100%, we can set up the equation: 20/100X + 28/100X = 100%. Solving for X, we get X = 550. Therefore, the answer is A: 550. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer isA: 550.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is equal to 51. So we can write an equation: n + (n + 1) + ... + (n + k - 1) = 51. Now, we are given that the least integer is -50, so we can substitute this value in the equation: -50 + (-50 + 1) + ... + (-50 + k - 1) = 51. Simplifying the equation, we get: k(k + 1)/2 = 51. Solving for k, we get k = 40. Therefore, the answer is A: 40.

Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
A: Let's think step by step.The length and width of the original rectangle are both equal to 20 cm, so we can call them x. Since it is a square, all sides have the same measure. So, the radius of each semicircle is half of that value or x/2. Now, let’s calculate the area of each semicircle using the formula for an arc sector: Area = (θ × r^2) / 4 Where θ is the angle subtended at the center of the circle by the arc, which is half of the central angle formed by the two radii passing through the center of the circle. In this case, the central angle is 360° - 180° = 180°. So, θ = 180°. Substituting values, we get: Area = (180° × (x/2)^2) / 4 = (180° × x^2 / 4) / 4 = x^2 / 8 Now, since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the remaining paper will be twice the area of one semi-circle. Therefore, the answer is option (A

A: Let's think step by step.The formula for calculating the present value of a single amount is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV represents the present value, FV represents the future value, and r represents the interest rate per period. In this case, we know that the face value of the bond is $5,000, the interest rate is 12%, and the time period is one year or six periods. So, we can calculate the present value of the bond as follows: PV = $5,000 / (1 + 0.12)^6 = $4,739.69 Therefore, the answer is A: $5102.

A: Let's think step by step.We know there is a 90% probability that any given registered voter in Burghtown voted in the previous election. So if we choose five registered voters randomly from Burghtown, the probability that all five voted in the past election is (0.9)^5 = 0.71 or approximately 71%. Now, to find the probability that exactly four out of these five voters voted in the previous election, we need to subtract the probability that none of them did so (which is 0.71 x 0.05 = 0.035), resulting in an approximate answer of 65.6%. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Radha is 6th from the right end, so she is at position 5. Now when Radha moves two positions to the left, she will be at position 3. So, the position of Radha after moving two positions to the left is 3. Similarly, we know that Neha is 12th from the left end, so she is at position 14. Now when Neha moves two positions to the right, she will be at position 16. Therefore, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha, i.e., positions 3 to 10. Hence, the answer is option A - 23.

Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's think step by step.If we buy new tires, it costs us $180 per tire. So, in total, if we buy two tires, it would be $360 ($180 x 2). Now, let's consider the option where we get our existing tires repaired. It costs $40 per tire to repair them, so again, if we want to repair both tires, it would be $80 ($40 x 2). Now, let's calculate the difference between these two options. New tires - Repair Cost = $360 - $80 = $280. Therefore, the percentage increase in cost from buying new tires over repairing existing ones is: Percentage Increase = ($280 / $180) x 100% = 16.7%. Hence, the answer is (D) 16.7%.

Q: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's think step by step.We know that both cars start their commutes at the same time and move in the same direction. Now we need to find out how far they will be after some time has passed. To do this, we can use the formula distance = speed x time. For Car A, the distance traveled is 55 mph x time, and for Car B, it's 52 mph x time. Since they start their commutes at the same time, they will be the same distance apart initially. However, as time passes, Car A will cover more distance than Car B due to its higher speed. So, after some time has passed, they will be separated by an amount equal to the difference between their speeds multiplied by the time elapsed. In this case, the difference between their speeds is 3 mph (55 - 52), so if they have been moving for t hours, the distance between them is: Distance = 3 mph x t = 0.03 x t miles Where t is the time in hours. Solving for t, we get: t = distance / speed = 0.03 x t / 55 = 0.06 x 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A) 3 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.The cost price of one bag of ice is $1.25. Since the store makes a 20% profit, the selling price of each bag of ice will be $1.25 x 1.2 = $1.50. Now, if the store sells 500 bags of ice, its total revenue will be 500 x $1.50 = $750. Its total profit will be $750 - $375 = $375. Therefore, option A is correct.

A: Let's think step by step.Distance = Speed x Time taken for journey = 60 km/h x 20 h = 1200 km. Now if we want to cover this distance in 10 hours instead of 20 hours, then time taken will decrease and so will the speed required to cover that distance in given time. So, new speed = Total distance / New time taken = 1200 km / 10 h = 120 km/h. Therefore, option A is correct answer i.e., the car gains a speed of 80 km/h.

A: Let's think step by step.Since there are 10 types of books, we can represent them using at most 10 distinct letters. Now, since each book is assigned either a single letter or a pair of letters, the total number of unique combinations is at most 2^10 = 1024. So, the smallest number of letters Amy needs to use is 3, as this is the minimum number of letters needed to represent 1024 unique combinations. Therefore, answer choice A is correct.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Q is younger than R, so we can say that Q's age = R's age + x, where x is a positive integer. Since R is older than T by 10 years, we have: R's age = T's age + 10. Now, according to the problem statement, the sum of R and T's ages is equal to 50 years, which gives us: R's age + T's age = 50. Solving for R's age, we get: R's age = 30. Therefore, the difference between R's age and Q's age is 20 years (Q's age - R's age). So, the answer is (B) 27.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the height of the room is equal to half of the semi-perimeter, which we are given as 2:5 = x meters. So, the semi-perimeter of the room is 2x meters. Now, we need to find out how much paper will be required to cover the walls of the room. Since the width of the paper is 50 cm, the length of the paper needed will be twice the height of the room, i.e., 2x meters. Therefore, the total cost of papering the walls of the room will be 2x x Rs.2/meter = Rs.400. Finally, since there is an area of 15 square meters for doors and windows, we can subtract this from the total area of the room to get the remaining area available for papering the walls, which is 15 - 15 = 0 square meters. Hence, option A is correct.

Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000 + Rs.120,000 = Rs.220,000
Now, we are given that C got Rs.150,000 as his share of the profits. So, the total amount invested by C is:
Rs.150,000 / (Total Profit/Number of Months) = Rs.150,000 / Rs.375,000 = 4 months

A: Let's think step by step.If Janice bikes at 10 mph and has been biking for x hours, then she has traveled a distance of 10x miles. Similarly, if Jennie bikes at 20 mph and has been biking for y hours, then she has traveled a distance of 20y miles. To find the total distance traveled by both girls together in one hour, we can add their individual distances: Total Distance = 10x + 20y miles. Now, to find out how many hours it takes them to bike 1 mile together, we divide the total distance by their combined speed: Time = Total Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (10x + 20y) miles/hour. Solving for y, we get: y = 1/((10x + 20)/1) = 1/6 = 0.17 minutes. So, after 0.17 minutes or approximately 1 minute and 9 seconds, they will have collectively biked 1 mile.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that all 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, the total number of infected files = 250. Now, we are told that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This means that if x files are infected by both a virus and a worm, then the number of files infected only by a worm is 2x.

A: Let's think step by step.Train M leaves City A at 5 am, so it covers a distance of x km/hr. Since it takes 4 hours to reach City B, we can calculate its speed as follows: Speed = Distance / Time = x km/hr / 4 hrs = 2x km/hr Now, let's find out when Trains M and N will meet each other. We know that Train N leaves City B at 7 am, which means it has covered a distance of y km in this time. So, the relative speed between these two trains is given by: Relative speed = Speed of Train M + Speed of Train N = 2x km/hr + y km/hr = (2x + y)/(x - y) Now, we need to find the point where the two trains intersect. To do this, we set up an equation using the above formula: (2x + y)/(x - y) = 1030 - 5 = 1025 Solving for x, we get: x = 1000 km y = 30 km Therefore, the two trains cross each other exactly after covering a total distance of 1000 km

Q: Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts. Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the shorter ant casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. If we divide this value by two since there are only two ants, then we get the length of the shadow cast by each ant as follows: Length of shadow = Shadow length / Number of ants = 10 / 2 = 5 inches So, the longer ant casts a shadow that is 5 inches long. Therefore, the correct answer is option A - 36 inches.

Q: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's think step by step.The store started with 600 golf balls, which means that after selling 80%, we need to find out what percentage of the remaining golf balls are left. So, 600 x 80 = 480 (remaining). Now, since they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, if they sold all their white golf balls, then the number of yellow golf balls left is also half of the remaining golf balls. Therefore, 480 / 2 = 240 yellow golf balls were left at the end of the day. Hence, option A is correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer isA: 80.

A: Let's think step by step.At 8:00 AM, there were 3 times as much food left in the bowl as there are minutes until noon. So, if there are x minutes until noon, then there are 3x grams of food left in the bowl initially. Now, we know that the dog eats exactly once per hour, so it takes 60 minutes for the dog to finish eating all the food. Therefore, after 60 minutes, there will be 3x / 60 = 1/2 of the initial amount of food left in the bowl. Since the dog starts eating at 8:00 AM and finishes at noon, the percentage of the original food left in the bowl at noon is: (1/2) \* (3x / 60) = 30%. So, the answer is B: 25%.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's think step by step.The cost of one paper is $4 on Sunday and $1 otherwise. So if we want to find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday, we need to know what fraction of the total number of papers the hotel buys on Monday compared to Sunday. We are told that the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on other days, so the ratio of papers bought on Monday to papers bought on Sunday is 2:1 or 2/1 = 2. Therefore, the hotel buys half as many papers on Monday as it does on Sunday, i.e., 1/2 x 4 = 2 papers on Monday. Hence, answer choice (A) 15 is correct.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that one side of Julie's yard is 100 feet wide and the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. So, we can set up an equation using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Area = Length x Width = 100 ft x ? = 3,000 sq ft Now, we are asked to find the value of the length of the other side of the yard. Since this side is not given as 100 feet wide, we can rule out option A. Therefore, the answer is B: 20 feet.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that if the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then the remaining balls must be selected in 45 different ways. So, we have 45 choices for the first ball and 44 choices for the second ball (since one ball has already been selected). Therefore, the total number of ways to select two balls from the box is:
45 x 44 = 2020
Now, we want to find out what value of n will give us this number of ways. To do this, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:
n + 1 = 2020

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total number of workers is 10, and they work for 8 hours per day. So, the total amount of work done per day = Total number of workers x Hours worked per day = 10 x 8 = 80 units. Now, we are given that if 5 men work for 4 hours per day, then they can complete 5 x 4 = 20 units of work in one day. Therefore, the rate at which each man works = Amount of work done / Time taken to do it = 20 / 4 = 5 units per hour. Similarly, if y men work for y hours per day, their rate of production will be y / y = 1 unit per hour. Now, let's find out how many units of work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. The formula to calculate this is: Total amount of work done = Number of men x Rate of production x Time taken to do it. In this case, the number of men is y, the rate of production is 1 unit/hour, and the time taken to do the work is y days. Substituting these values, we

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the volume of the rectangular solid is given as 3x4x15 = 120 cubic units. Since all eight vertices of the solid are on the sphere, we can draw a circle through these points and pass through their centers. The radius of this circle will be half the length of any line segment joining two adjacent vertices. So let's find the distance between two adjacent vertices.
Let V1 and V2 be two adjacent vertices of the solid, located at (x1, y1), (x2, y2). Then, the distance between them is given by:
distance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
Now, since all eight vertices lie on the same circle, we have:
distance = constant
So, we can set up an equation using the above formula:
(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = r^2
where r is the radius of the circle. Solving for r, we get:
r = sqrt(80) = 13.3542
Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2

Similarly, since minor arc BD is 150°, we know that minor arc DB = 150° - (90° + 90°) = 60°. Now, if B bisects minor arc AC, then angle BAC = 90°. Therefore, minor arc AD = 180° - (90° + 60°) = 130°.

A: Let's think step by step.The cost of the initial quarter-mile is $3.50, so we have spent that much already. For every subsequent quarter-mile, we pay an extra $0.10. So if we travel another quarter-mile after the initial one, our total cost will be $3.60 ($3.50 + $0.10). If we continue to add up these costs as we travel more quarters, we reach a point where the total cost equals $8.50. To find this point, let's set up an equation using the formula C = d \* m, where C is the total cost, d is the distance traveled, and m is the cost per unit distance: C = d \* m Substituting the given values, we get: C = d \* m = 8.50 $ 3.50 $ 0.10^n Where n is the number of quarter-miles traveled.

To find out what was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to add up all these values and divide by the total number of months: Average = (504 + 200) / 32 = 704/32 = 22.5 microwave ovens per month on average. So, the answer is option (A): 21 microwave ovens per month. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A).

Q: The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to their bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes just $4,000. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators. How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot's? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total amount contributed is $20,000 ($16,000 + $4,000). Since they want to influence 30 senators, we need to divide this amount among those senators. So, each senator gets $667 ($20,000 / 30 = $667). Now, since Hoopsmot contributed $16,000, he influenced 18 senators ($16,000 / $667 = 18). Therefore, answer choice A is correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer isA: 18.

A: Let's think step by step.The formula to find the height of an object is given by: Shadow = Height x Cosine of angle between the line of sight and the ground. So, in this case, we know that the height of the electric pole is 14 meters, and its shadow on the ground is 10 meters. Now, we need to find the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the ground. Since the sun is overhead, the angle between the line of sight and the ground is at right angles or 90 degrees. Therefore, the cosine of this angle is 0. So, using the formula above, we can calculate the height of the tree as follows: Shadow = Height x Cosine of angle between the line of sight and the ground = 10 m x 0 = 0 meters. Therefore, the height of the tree is 0 meters. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A) 21.

A: Let's think step by step.The bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, which means that if it visits x flowers, it will bypass x/100 = 0.05x flowers. So, the number of flowers the bee will visit is x - 0.05x = 99.95x. Now, we want to find out how many flowers the bee will bypass. That is, we want to know how many flowers the bee will visit before it reaches the 8th flower it wants to collect nectar from. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of flowers the bee visits by 8: x - 0.05x / 8 = 7.5x. Solving for x, we get x = 12800. So, the bee will fly by 12800 flowers before reaching the 8th one it wants to collect nectar from. Hence, the answer is option (A): 2000.

A: Let's think step by step.The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. Since Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard, we know that the total length of fencing needed is equal to 3P. Now, we are told that the yard has an area of 240 square meters, which means its length and width are related as follows: Area = Length x Width = 240 m^2 So, if we let L be the length of the yard, we can write: Length = Area / Width = 240/W Where W is the width of the yard. Now, since one side of the yard is left unfenced, it must have a length of 10 meters. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation for the total length of fencing needed: Total Fencing Needed = 3P = 3(2L + W) Substituting the values we know, we get: Total Fencing Needed = 3(2L + W) = 3(2(240)/W + W) = 3(480 + W) Finally, we

A: Let's think step by step.We know that if x < 0, then y > 0 since x is negative and y is positive. Now, we need to find out what happens when we square both sides of the inequality. So, let's square both sides:
$$\begin{align\*}
x^2 & < y^2 \tag{since $x$ is negative} \\
-x^4 & < y^4 \tag{by squaring both sides}

A: Let's think step by step.We have a total of 11 candy bars. Three of them cost 50 cents each, which means we need to pay 3 x 50 = $1.50 for those. Four of them cost $1 each, which means we need to pay 4 x $1 = $4. So far, our total cost is $1.50 + $4 = $5.50. Now, we are left with 4 candy bars that cost $2 each. To select 3 of these, we will pay $2 x 3 = $6. Therefore, the total cost of selecting 3 candy bars from this bag is $5.50 + $6 = $11.50.
So, there are 3 ways to select 3 candy bars from the given bag such that their total cost is more than $4:
(A) 8 - Selecting 3 candy bars that cost $1 each and paying $3 = $8.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's think step by step.The revenue from sales = number of components sold x selling price per component. Since they sell all their components by the end of each month, we can assume that the total revenue for one month is equal to the number of components produced times the selling price per component. So, in one month, the revenue would be: Revenue = 420 components x $110/component = $45,200. Now, let's calculate the yearly profit: Yearly Profit = Revenue - Production Costs = ($45,200/month x 12 months) - $110/component x 420 components = $5,476,400 - $448,800 = $5,027,600. To ensure a profit of at least $626,400, we need to set the selling price per component such that the yearly profit is greater than or equal to this amount. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is: Minimum Selling Price = $626,400 / Number of Components Sold = $626,4

A: Let's think step by step.We know that events A and B are independent, so we can multiply their probabilities to find the joint probability: P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). Since the probability of event A occurring is 0.6, and the probability of event B occurring is also 0.6, we have: P(A ∩ B) = 0.6 × 0.6 = 0.36. Now, we want to find the probability that event B occurs. To do this, we need to subtract the probability of both events from 1: P(B) = 1 - P(A ∩ B) = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Therefore, the answer is option (A): P(B) = 0.5.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that 60% of the people in the survey are women and they prefer blue cars to green cars. So among the remaining 40%, there will be more men than women. Now we need to find out what percentage of men preferred red cars over green cars. According to the question, 75% of the men who were surveyed preferred red cars over green cars. Therefore, if x is the total number of people in the survey, then the number of men = 0.4x (since 60% of the people are women). And the number of men who preferred red cars = 0.4x \* 0.75 = 0.3x. Now we have two equations: 0.4x + 0.6x = 100 ( since 100 people like either blue or red cars) 0.3x + 0.6x = 80 ( since 80 people like either green or red cars) Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 120.

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's think step by step.The given coin has an alloy of aluminum and silver with a total weight of 30 g. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, we can write: Aluminum volume = Silver volume = 1/2 x π x (15 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 30 mm^3 Silver volume = 30 mm^3 / 2 = 15 mm^3 Now, let's find out how much aluminum there is in the coin: Aluminum mass = Total weight - Silver mass = 30 g - (2 x 15 mm x 2 mm x density of silver) = 30 g - (30 mm x 2 mm x density of silver) = ...

How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step.We know that after 20 tosses, neither of them gained or lost anything. So, if the coin had landed on Heads more than once, they would have earned at least one dollar from their respective wagers. Since this didn't happen, we can conclude that the number of times the coin landed on Heads is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, option A is correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A): The coin landed on Heads fewer than 10 times.

A: Let's think step by step.We are given that (?) = (a - b)2. Now, we need to find what should come in place of the question mark (?) in each of the options.
Option A: In this case, if we replace the question mark with (a + b), we get (a + b)2 = (a - b)2. This is not true as (a + b)2 is greater than (a - b)2. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.
Option B: If we replace the question mark with (a - b)2, we get (a - b)2 = (a - b)2. This is true, so Option B is correct.
Option C: When we replace the question mark with (a + b)2, we get (a + b)2 = (a - b)2. This is also false, just like Option A. So, Option C is incorrect.
Option D: Replacing the question mark with a3 + b3 gives us a3 + b3 = a3 + b3. This is true, so Option D is correct.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Bill's average speed on a non-windy day is 15 mph. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his actual speed = 15 - 4 = 11 mph. Now we need to find out how far he can travel in 21 minutes at this speed. Time taken = Distance traveled / Speed = 21 min / 11 mph = 1.90 hours (or 1 hour and 9 minutes). So, the distance traveled = Speed x Time = 11 mph x 1.90 hrs = 2.19 miles. Therefore, the answer is A: 2 miles.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the original retail price of the appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. So, if the wholesale cost is x, the original retail price would be 60 percent more = 1.6x. Now, we are told that the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. This means that the sale price of the appliance is 20 percent less than 1.6x = 1.32x. Therefore, the appliance was sold for 32 percent more than its wholesale cost. Option A is the correct answer.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Winson ran from his home to his school at a rate of 10 miles per hour, so he covered 10 miles in 1 hour = 10 miles/hour x 1 hour = 10 miles. Now, we need to find out how far he walked back home. Since he walked at a rate of 5 miles per hour, it will take him half an hour to walk back home = 5 miles/hour x 0.5 hours = 2.5 miles. So, the total distance between his home and school is 10 + 2.5 = 12.5 miles. Therefore, option A is correct.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the square of one number is 256000 more than the other number squared. So, if x is the smaller number, then x^2 = 256000 + y^2, where y is the larger number. Now we can simplify this equation as follows: x^2 - y^2 = 256000. Since the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we have: x + y = 1000. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 600 and y = 400. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: 600, 400.

A: Let's think step by step.The area of the rectangle is given as 340 meters, which means its length and width are both equal to 340/2 = 170 meters. So, the perimeter of the rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. Since the perimeter is given as 340 meters, we can set up the equation: 2(l + w) = 340. Solving for l and w, we get: l = 170 meters and w = 170 meters. Now, let's find out the area of the rectangle: Area = l x w = 170 x 170 = 28900 square meters. To find out the cost of gardening the boundary, we need to know how many square meters of boundary are needed. Let's assume that the boundary is 1 meter wide, so it has an area of 1 square meter. Therefore, the total area of the boundary is: Area of boundary = Perimeter of boundary / Width of boundary = 340 / 1 = 340 square meters. Finally, we can calculate the

A: Let's think step by step.We have the equation:
(5 + x × 19 - 15 - 7)/(13 × 13 - 156) = 6
First, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
(5 + x × 19 - 15 - 7) / (13 × 13 - 156) = (5 + 19x - 22 - 7) / (13 × 13 - 156)
Now, let's factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two expressions inside the parentheses:
(5 + 19x - 22 - 7) / (13 × 13 - 156) = (5 + 19x - 22 - 7) / (13 × 10 - 140)
Now we can see that the expression on the right-hand side is a simplified form of the original equation! So, the answer is option A: 4.

How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's think step by step.We know that 8% of total students are interested in football, which means 8% x Total Students = Number of students interested in Football. Now we have to find out how much percentage is left after subtracting number of students interested in cricket from total students. So, 4/5 x Total Students = Number of students interested in Cricket. Now we need to find out what percentage of students are interested in basketball. So, 10% x Total Students = Number of students interested in Basketball. Finally, we need to add up all these percentages to get the total number of students in the class. So, Total Students = Number of students interested in Football + Number of students interested in Cricket + Number of students interested in Basketball + Remaining students who are not interested in any game. Substituting values given in the question, we get: Total Students = 8% x Total Students = 8% x 1000 = 800 + 4/5 x 1000 = 400 + 100 = 1300. Therefore, there are 1300 students in the class.

A: Let's think step by step.The original rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a width of 17 cm, so its area is: Area = Length x Width = 27 x 17 = 469 cm^2 Now, we are asked to convert it into a square. To do this, we need to divide the rectangle into four equal parts along its diagonals. So, the length and breadth of the square will be half of the original dimensions. Therefore, the length and breadth of the square are: Length = Half of 27 = 13.5 cm Breadth = Half of 17 = 8.5 cm Now, the area of the square is: Area = Length x Breadth = 13.5 x 8.5 = 112.25 cm^2 Therefore, the answer is option (B): 11 cm.

A: Let's think step by step.If we have a gallon of soft drink that contains 40% orange juice, then it means that for every 100 ml of the soft drink, there are 40 ml of orange juice. Now, if we want to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add more orange juice to the mixture so that its proportion becomes 60/40 = 3/2 = 1.5 times as much as before.

A: Let's think step by step.The shopkeeper pays the servant a monthly salary of Rs 1500 and an additional commission of 15% on sales above Rs 1500. So, the total amount paid to the servant is: Salary + Commission = Rs 1500 + (15% of Rs 1500) = Rs 1500 + Rs 225 = Rs 1725 per month. To find out how much sale the servant needs to make to earn a monthly income of Rs 6000, we can set up the following equation: Total Amount Received = Sales x Commission Percentage Total Amount Received = Rs 6000 x 15% Total Amount Received = Rs 9000 Now, we know that the total amount received by the servant is Rs 9000, so the sale must be: Sale = Total Amount Received / Commission Percentage Sale = Rs 9000 / 15% Sale = Rs 60000 (approximately).

So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = Speed x Time. Now, let's find out how much time it takes for the plane to cover 180 miles. Since the plane moves 10 times faster than the ship, it will take half the time for the plane to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the plane is: Time = Distance / Speed = 180 / 10x = t/2 Where t is the time taken by the ship to cover 180 miles. Now, we need to find out what value of t satisfies both the equations. Substituting the value of t from the second equation into the first one, we get: Distance = Speed x Time = x x t/2 = 180 Thus, the distance between them when they meet is 180 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 238 miles. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A) 238 miles.

Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the original price of the item was x dollars. After a 22% discount, the new price would be 0.78x or 78% of the original price. So if the customer pays $y dollars for the item after applying the $20-off coupon, we can set up the equation: 0.78x = y - 20. Now solve for x: x = y / 0.78 = $61. Therefore, the original price of the item was $61. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A): $61.

Q: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed? Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
A: Let's think step by step.We know that each student selected two favorite songs from a list of 10 songs. So, for every student, we have 10 choices to select their favorites. Since each student is selecting two songs, the total number of selections made by all students will be twice the number of songs on the list. Therefore, if there are 10 songs on the list, the total number of selections will be 2 x 10 = 20. Now, since each student selected one of these 20 songs as their favorite, and they did this 5 times, the total number of selections made by all students will be 20 x 5 = 100. So, option A is correct - 96 students were surveyed.

Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
A: Let's think step by step.Fernando has 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week = 3L + 3D = 10 meals in total. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, Fernando can only use 7 days - Saturday to Friday = 7 days to distribute his meals. Now, let's count the number of ways we can allocate those meals: Lunches: He can choose any 3 out of 7 days for lunch = C(7,3) = 5C3 = 10 options Dinner: Similarly, he can choose any 3 out of 7 days for dinner = C(7,3) = 5C3 = 10 options Total options: We multiply the number of options for lunches and dinners = 10 x 10 = 100 options Therefore, option A is correct!

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Roberts' real estate value is $1023.65, but according to the document, its recorded value is an odd positive number less than or equal to $1023.65 and divisible by 100. So we can write: Recorded value = $ x 100 where $ is an odd positive number less than or equal to $1023.65. Now, we have two equations: Real Estate Value = $1023.65 and Recorded Value = $x100. Solving for $ gives us: $ = 1023.65 - 100 = 923.65. Therefore, the difference between the true value and the recorded value is $923.65 - $1023.65 = -$100.

Q: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ≠ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's think step by step.We are given that L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Now we need to find out whether there exists any pair of positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y).
Let us first consider the case where x = y = a, say. Then we have:
L(a,a) = [a] + [a] + [a+a] = 3a
R(a,a) = [2a] + [2a] = 4a
So in this case, L(x,y) = R(x,y), i.e., option (A) holds true.
Now let us consider the case where x = b > a and y = c > a. Then we have:
L(b,c) = [b] + [c] + [b+c] = 3b + 3c
R(b,c) = [2b] + [2c] = 4b + 4c

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person? Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the bus fare for two people traveling between Agra and Aligarh is equal to four-thirds of the train fare for one person. So, if we divide the train fare by three, we get the bus fare as follows: Train fare = Four-thirds × Bus fare = 3 × 126 = 388 Now, let's find out how much each passenger pays when they travel together in a bus or train. For six passengers on a bus: Total bus fare = Number of passengers × Bus fare per passenger = 6 × 126 = 756 For eight passengers on a train: Total train fare = Number of passengers × Train fare per passenger = 8 × 388 = 3072 Now, we are given that the sum of the fares paid by all these passengers is Rs.1512. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 756 + 3072 = 1512 Solving this equation gives us: 388 = 1512 / 9 = 170 So, the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh

A: Let's think step by step.The amount borrowed is Rs.360 and the number of instalments is 12. So, each instalment is equal to the total amount divided by 12 = Rs.31.50. Now, we need to find out the interest paid on this loan. Interest = Principal x Rate x Time = Rs.360 x x x 12 months Where 'x' represents the interest rate as a decimal value. Therefore, the interest paid = Rs.360 x x x 12 = Rs.432. Since the interest paid is more than the principal amount, the interest rate must be positive. So, the answer is option (A): 1.5%.

A: Let's think step by step.The given information states that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month, which means he has a total expenditure of Rs. 3500 x 12 = Rs. 42,000 per year. Now, we are told that he saves 12 1/2% of his income, so his savings amount can be calculated as follows: Savings = Income x Savings Percentage = 42,000 x 12.5% = Rs. 5,300 per year. Since he saves Rs. 5,300 per year, his annual income must be at least Rs. 42,000 + Rs. 5,300 = Rs. 47,300 per year. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the total value of all coins is Rs. 700. So, we can write an equation:
Total Value = Number of 25 paise coins + Number of 50 paise coins + Number of One Rupee coins
Now, let's find out how many coins of each denomination are present in the pouch:
Number of 25 paise coins = Total Value / 25 paise = 700 / 25 = 28
Number of 50 paise coins = Total Value / 50 paise = 700 / 50 = 14
Number of One Rupee coins = Total Value - (Number of 25 paise coins x Price of 1 25 paise coin) - (Number of 50 paise coins x Price of 1 50 paise coin)
Price of 1 25 paise coin = Rs. 2.50

A: Let's think step by step.We are given that $n$ satisfies the inequality $36 \leq n \leq 72$. So, we can write $n = m^2$, where $m$ is an integer between $36$ and $72$. Now, let's substitute this value of $n$ in the expression for $x$: $$x = \frac{(m^2 + 2\sqrt{m}(m + 4) + 16)}{m + 4\sqrt{m} + 4}$$ Simplifying the expression, we get: $$x = \frac{m^2 + 8m + 16}{m + 4m + 4}$$ Since $m$ is an integer between $36$ and $72$, we have $m + 4m + 4$ is always even. Therefore, the numerator and denominator of the fraction are both integers. So, the fraction simplifies to: $$x = \frac{m^2 + 8m}{m + 4}$$ Now, we need to find the range of values of $m$ that satisfy the inequality $20 < x < 54$. Using the fact that $m

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the probability of an event is equal to the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, we want to find P(A/B), which means we need to divide the probability of A given B by the probability of B. So, let's first calculate the probability of B: P(B) = 0.8. Now, we can use the definition of conditional probability to get P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). Since A and B are independent, we have P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B). Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). Now, we want to find P(A/B), which is the probability of A given B. This is equivalent to finding P(A|B) multiplied by P(B): P(A/B) = P(A|B) × P(B) = (0.2) / (0.8) = 0.25 or 25%.

A: Let's think step by step.The problem states that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour. So if the selling price is x, then the cost price = x / 1.25. Now we are given that the total profit made by the grocer is $3,000. Therefore, the total number of bags sold can be found using the equation: Total Profit = Number of Bags x Cost Price per Bag x Profit Percentage. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total Profit = Number of Bags x $100 x 25%. Solving for Number of Bags, we get: Number of Bags = Total Profit / ($100 x 25%). Simplifying, we get: Number of Bags = $3,000 / ($100 x 25%) = 12 bags. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

Q: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
A: Let's think step by step.We know that distance = speed x time, so we can set up the equation d = s x t where d is the distance traveled, s is the speed of the cyclist in miles per hour, and t is the time taken to cover the distance. In this case, the distance is 48 miles, which we want to find out how long it would take to cover. The speed of the cyclist is given as 12 miles per hour, which means that if they were to travel for one hour, they would have covered a distance of 12 miles. So, we can substitute this value into our equation: d = s x t Now, we are asked to find out how many minutes it would take to cover the distance of 48 miles. To do this, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: min = h x 60 Where h is the number of hours taken to cover the distance. Since the cyclist is traveling at a constant speed of 12 miles per hour, they will cover the entire distance in just one hour, since there are no obstacles or breaks in their journey. Therefore, the answer is (B): 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(B) 240 minutes.

Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step.The train was initially moving at $100 \text{ miles}/\text{hour}$. In $10$ hours, it covers $\frac {1}{4}$ of the distance, which means it travels for $\frac {1}{4} \times 100 = 25$ hours at this initial speed. Now, due to rain, the speed reduces to $75 \text{ miles}/\text{hour}$, so in the remaining time ($65$ hours), it covers half of the distance, i.e., $\frac {1}{2} \times 25 = 12.5$ hours. Therefore, the total journey duration is $25 + 12.5 = 37.5$ hours.

A: Let's think step by step.The distance between home and work is given as 20 km, which means that if the worker drives, he/she covers this distance in 9 minutes. Now, we are asked how long it would take for the worker to cycle along the same route. We know that the cycling speed is half of the driving speed, i.e., 6 km/h = 1/2 x 20 km/h. Therefore, the time taken to cover the distance of 20 km while cycling is: Time = Distance / Speed = 20 km / 6 km/h = 3.33 minutes. So, option A is the correct answer.

A: Let's think step by step.The width of a single picket is 1/2 inch = 0.5 inch. Since there are x pickets in total, their total width is x x 0.5 inch = x ft. Now, we know that there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, so the distance between two adjacent pickets is 6 inches. Therefore, the length of one picket is L = 6 inches / x = 6x/x = 6. So, the length of the entire fence is LF = x x 6 = 6x ft. Hence, option (A) is correct.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that six pita breads have the same amount of falafel as two rolls, so we can write an equation based on this information:
6 pita breads = 2 rolls
Now, we are told that three rolls have the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. So, we can use this information to create another equation:
3 rolls = 5 baguettes
Next, we are given that two baguettes have the same amount of falafel as one pita bread. Therefore, we can form a fourth equation:
2 baguettes = 1 pita bread
Now, let's try to find the value of x in terms of y. We know that there are 25 pita breads and 3 rolls, so we can write:
25 pita breads + 3 rolls = ?
We also know that there are 20 baguettes, so we can add them to our equation:

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Sachin's current batting average is 51 and after scoring 78 runs in the final match his new batting average becomes 54. So we can write an equation as follows: Batting Average = Total Runs / Matches Played Now we are given that Sachin has played x matches in this season. Substituting the value of x into the above equation, we get: 54 = 78/x Therefore, we have to find the value of x. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 78: x = 78/54 Now, we know that Sachin's batting average is 51 initially, which means that he scored 51 runs in one match. Similarly, if he plays x matches, he will score x \* 51 runs. So, the total number of runs scored by Sachin in this season is: Total Runs = x \* 51 Now, we want to find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Allen takes x hours to reach y. So, we can write an equation as follows: Distance = Speed * Time. Now, let’s analyze what happens in each case: Case 1: When Allen moves from X to Y, he covers a distance of 54 km/h × t hours = 54t km. Similarly, when Bob moves from Y to X, he covers a distance of 78 km/h × t hours = 78t km. Since both start simultaneously, their meeting point is halfway between X and Y. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is equal to half the total distance traveled by both. So, the answer is A - 144 km. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer isA – 144 km.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the monthly salary of the shop assistant is equal to the sum of a fixed salary and 5% of all monthly sales. So, we can write an equation as follows: Salary = Fixed + Percentage of Sales Where "Fixed" represents the fixed salary of $500, and "Percentage of Sales" represents 5% of all monthly sales. Now, we want to find out what the monthly sales need to be for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500. To do this, we will substitute the given values into the equation above: Salary = $500 + (5% of Monthly Sales) Substituting $500 for "Fixed": Salary = $500 + (5% of Monthly Sales) Now, let's solve for "Monthly Sales" to find out how much they need to be for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500: Monthly Sales = Salary / ($500 + (5% of Monthly Sales)) Simplifying the expression: Monthly Sales = $1500 / ($50

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
A: Let's think step by step.We have a total of 28 white tulips, so we can make at most 28/3 = 9 bouquets with only white tulips. Since there are 98 red tulips, we can make at most 98/3 = 32 bouquets with only red tulips. Now, we need to find the maximum number of bouquets we can make using both colors. The key here is that each bouquet must contain an equal number of white and red tulips, since you said "no flowers are to be left out". So, we can make at most 32 / 2 = 16 bouquets with both colors. Therefore, the answer is (D) 14.

A: Let's think step by step.The question states that a liquid goes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons per second. To find out how long it takes for y gallons to go through the drain, we need to divide the number of gallons by the rate at which they are passing through the drain. So, if y gallons of liquid are passed through the drain in time t seconds, then the rate at which they are passing through is w/25 gallons per second. Therefore, the time taken for y gallons to pass through the drain is given by:
time = y / (w/25)
Now, let’s substitute the values given in the options:
Option A: y = 40, w = 10, and x = 60. Substituting these values into the formula above, we get:
time = 40 / (10/25) = 80 seconds

A: Let's think step by step.Distance = Speed x Time taken for forward journey = 6 hours x 60 km/h = 360 km. Now, during the return journey, we know that the speed of the jeep increases by 12 km/h, so the time taken for the return journey will be less than 6 hours. Let's assume the new time taken for the return journey is x hours. Then, distance traveled = Speed x Time taken = 60 km/h x x = 360 km + (x - 6) x 12 km/h. Solving for x, we get x = 4 hours. So, the distance traveled by the jeep is 360 km + (4 - 6) x 12 km/h = 360 km + (-2) x 12 km/h = 358 km. Therefore, the correct answer is option (A): 126 km.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that M > N, so we can write M - N = x. Now, according to the problem statement, M - N + 396c = 990. Subtracting 396c from both sides gives us 990 - 396x = 100. Simplifying this equation, we get 594x = 100. Dividing both sides by 594 gives us x = 17. So, there is only one value of M that is greater than 300, which is M = 300 + 17 = 317.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the sum of the digits of the number is 17, so it can be represented as follows: Number = 10x + 10y + z Where x, y, and z are the digits of the number. Since the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, we have: (x+y+z)^2 = 109 So, we can write: (x+y+z)^2 = 109 Subtracting 495 from the above equation gives us: (x-y-z)^2 = -386 Now, we need to find the value of x, y, and z such that the resulting number consists of the same digits written in the reverse order. Solving for x, y, and z, we get: x = 9, y = 7, and z = 4 Therefore, the number is 368. Hence, option A is correct.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the age of each member is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. So, we can write the formula for the nth member as follows: Age of nth member = 7 + (n - 1) × 3 Where n is the number of members in the club. Now, according to the problem statement, the sum of the ages of all the members is equal to 250. Therefore, we can write: ∑(Age of nth member) = 250 Substituting the formula for Age of nth member, we get: ∑(7 + (n - 1) × 3) = 250 Simplifying the equation, we get: 7 + 3n - 3 = 250 Solving for n, we get: n = 26 So, there are 26 members in the club.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's think step by step.We know that ball A takes 26 minutes to complete one full rotation, so it covers distance = circumference of circle / time taken = πr / 26 where r is radius of circle. Now, we are told that both balls start rotating together after some time, say t hours. So, the distance covered by ball A between time t and time t + 26 minutes is equal to the distance covered by ball B between time t and time t + 35 minutes. Using the formula above, we can write: Distance covered by ball A = Circumference of circle / Time taken by ball A = πr / 26 Distance covered by ball B = Circumference of circle / Time taken by ball B = πr / 35 Since both balls started rotating simultaneously, their distances covered must be equal. Therefore, we have: πr / 26 = πr / 35 Solving for r, we get: r = 26/35 = 0.74 radians (or approximately 39.8 degrees) Now, we need to find out when the balls will be at the same starting point again.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the greatest common factor of 350 and x is 11, so we can divide both numbers by this factor to simplify them: 350 = 11 × 31 x = 11 × 29 Now we have a problem where the least common multiple is given as 7700. To find the value of x, we need to determine the smallest number that divides both 350 and x without leaving a remainder. In other words, we want to find the lowest number that is a divisor of both numbers. Using the prime factorization method, we can see that the prime factors of 350 are 2, 2, and 5, while the prime factors of x are 2, 3, and 7. Since 2 and 3 are common factors of both numbers, their product (2 × 3) must be a divisor of both numbers. Therefore, the least common multiple of 350 and x is 7700 / (2 × 3) = 7700 / 6 = 1283. So, the value of x is 29 × 128

Q: A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 ½ km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h
A: Let's think step by step.The man walked for a total of 6 + 12 = 18 hours. Now, we need to find his average speed. We know that the man walked at 5 kmph for 6 hours, so he covered a distance of 5 x 6 = 30 km during this time. Similarly, he walked at 4 kmph for 12 hours, covering a distance of 4 x 12 = 48 km. Therefore, his overall distance traveled is 30 + 48 = 78 km. To find his average speed, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: 78 km / 18 hours = 4.2 km/h. So, the answer is option (A): 4 1/3 km/h. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A).

A: Let's think step by step.We know that if we square both sides, we get x4 - 25x + 25 = 0. Now, let's factor out a constant from the left-hand side: x4 - 25x + 25 = (x2 - 5x + 5)(x2 - 5x - 5) = 0. So, we need to find values of 'k' such that either (x2 - 5x + 5) or (x2 - 5x - 5) are equal to zero. Solving for the first factor, we see that k = 5 has two real and distinct roots, so the answer is (A) 9.

Q: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that both ants are moving toward each other. So, we can write the equation for the total distance traveled by ant A as follows: Distance = Speed x Time + Constant Where, constant represents the initial distance between the two ants which is given as 75 cm in this case. Now, we have to find out the time taken by ant A to reach the point where it meets ant B. To do so, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Now, we know that the speed of ant A is 9 cm/hr and the distance between the two ants is 75 cm. Therefore, we can plug these values into the above formula to get: Time = 75 / 9 = 8.33 hours This means that ant A takes approximately 8.33 hours to meet ant B. Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we can convert the time to minutes as follows: Time = 8.33 x 60 = 499 minutes Now, we have found the time taken by ant A to meet ant B. But we were asked to give the distance traveled by ant A till then. To find this

Q: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.The company produces high-quality pens, and 10% of them are defective, which means they will not meet the standards for sale. So, out of 7200 pens, only 6480 pens (i.e., 7200 x 90%) will be sold. Now, we need to calculate the total revenue from these pens = Total number of pens sold x Price per pen. Since the price per pen is Rs. 10, the total revenue = 6480 pens x Rs. 10 = Rs. 64,800. Next, we need to find the manufacturing cost of each pen. We know that the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%, which means the remaining amount after deducting the manufacturing cost is equal to 25% of the selling price. Therefore, Manufacturing Cost = Selling Price x Profit Percentage / 100 = Rs. 64,800 x 25/100 = Rs. 16,200. So, the manufacturing cost of each pen is approximately R

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the three bells have an interval of 36, 40, and 48 seconds between them. So, if we add these intervals, we get: Bell 1 + Bell 2 + Bell 3 = 36 + 40 + 48 = 124 seconds.

Q: The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the cross section of the canal is a trapezium with widths W1 = 10m and W2 = 6m. Since it is a trapezium, we can find its area using the formula for an elongated triangle: Area = (b x h)/2 Where b = base and h = height. In this case, the base is equal to half the wider side (W1 + W2), which is 10 + 6 = 16m. And the height is equal to the distance between the two bases, which is half the length of the canal (L). So, L = 10 + 6 = 16m. Now we have all the values needed to calculate the area of the trapezium: Area = (16 x 8)/2 = 640 square meters. To find the depth of the canal, we need to divide the area by the width of the canal at the bottom (W2): Depth = Area/W2 = 640 / 6 = 10.67 meters. Therefore, the answer is A: 26 meters.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew is replaced by a new person. So, let's assume that the original weight of each oarsman was x kg. Now, if we replace one of them with a new person whose weight is y kg, then the total weight of all the oarsmen will be x + y kg. Since the average weight has increased by 1.8 kg, we can write: (x + y)/10 = (x/10) + 1.8. Solving for y, we get y = 62 kg. Therefore, the weight of the new man is 62 kg.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that if two numbers are in a ratio of 3:5, then after 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers will be in a ratio of 12:23. So we can write:
Original numbers = 3x + 9 and 5x + 9
After subtraction, new numbers = 12x + 27 and 23x + 27
Now, we need to find out which one is the smaller number. Let's substitute the values into the equations:
Original numbers = 3(6) + 9 = 18 + 9 = 27
New numbers = 12(4) + 27 = 48 + 27 = 75
So, the smaller number is 27. Therefore, the answer is (A) 21.

A: Let's think step by step.The given condition states that a two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number = 10x + y, where x and y are the digits of the number. Since the digit at the units place is twice the digit in the tens place, we have y = 2x. Substituting this value into the earlier equation, we get: Number = 10x + 2x = 12x. Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can set up the following inequality: 10x + 2x > 18. Simplifying the inequality, we get: 12x > 18. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. Therefore, the number is 6 times 10 plus 2 times 6, which equals 42. So, the answer is option C: 42.

A: Let's think step by step.We know both cars are moving in the same direction, so we can use relative motion to solve this problem. The relative speed between the two cars is the difference between their speeds: 13 - 12 = 1 mile/hour. Since there are 50 miles on the highway, it will take each car half as many hours to travel that distance: 50 / 2 = 25 hours. So, they will meet exactly 25 hours after starting.

A: Let's think step by step.The volume of a single small cube = 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm = 1 cubic centimeter. Since there are 5 cm in each dimension, the total volume of the large cube = 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 cubic centimeters. Now, since the thickness of the large cube is 1 cm, the number of layers of small cubes needed to make it up = Total volume of large cube / Volume of one small cube = 125 / 1 = 125. So, there are 125 layers of small cubes inside the large cube. As the outer surface of the large cube is painted, some faces of the small cubes will also be painted. But, as the question states that all faces of the smaller cubes are not painted, we can conclude that 125 - X faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted, where X is the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the ratio between the height of the flagpole and its shadow is equal to the ratio between the height of the building and its shadow. So we can write: Shadow of flagpole = Height of flagpole x Ratio Shadow/Height Building Shadow of building = Height of building x Ratio Shadow/Height Flagpole
We are given that the height of the flagpole is 17.5 meters and its shadow is 40.25 meters long. Therefore, we can calculate the ratio of the shadow to the height as follows: Ratio Shadow/Height Flagpole = Length of shadow / Height of flagpole = 40.25 m / 17.5 m = 2.31
Now, let's use this ratio to find the height of the building. We are given that the shadow of the building is 28.75 meters long. Using the same formula as before, we can calculate the height of the building as follows: Height of building = Ratio Shadow/Height Building x Length of shadow = 2.31 x 28.75 m = 66.975 m

A: Let's think step by step.The shopkeeper gave a discount of 20% on all items for one day, which means that if an item originally cost $x, it was sold for $x \times (1 - 0.20) = $x \times 0.80 = $0.8x. So, after the discount period is over and the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at their original prices again, he will have to charge $0.8x x 1.20 = $0.96x as the new price. To find out the percentage increase from the original price, we can subtract the old price from the new price and divide by the old price: ($0.96x - $x) / $x = 1.20 or 20%.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that initially, the mixture contained 10 kg of material, which was 30% sand and 70% clay. To make it contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove some of the clay and replace it with sand. So, let's start by removing an amount of clay equal to x kg, where x is the quantity of clay we want to remove. Now, the total weight of the mixture will become:
Mixture weight = Sand + Clay - x
We are given that the original mixture weight was 10 kg, so we can set up the equation:
Sand + Clay - x = 10
Now, we want to make sure that the proportion of sand and clay in the new mixture is the same as in the original mixture. Since the original mixture had 30% sand and 70% clay, we can write:
Sand = 30% of 10 kg = 3 kg
Clay = 70% of 10 kg = 7 kg
So, if we remove x kg of clay, the new proportion of sand and clay in the mixture will be:

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. This means that the distance traveled by the car during this period is equal to half the height of the tower divided by the sine of the angle of elevation. So, we can write: Distance = (height/sin(angle)) x Time = (h/sin(θ)) x 10 Where h is the height of the tower and θ is the angle of elevation. Now, we are asked to find out how much more time it would take for the car to reach the base of the tower. To do this, we need to divide the distance traveled by the car during the given time interval by the speed of the car. So, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car first: Distance = (h/sin(θ)) x 10 = (h/sin(45°)) x 10 = (h/sin(60°)) x 10 - (h/sin(45°)) x 10 Since the angle of elevation increases from 45° to 60°, we have sin

Q: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the average weight of the initial group of 10 vehicles = 12.2 tons. After adding a new heavy-duty truck, we need to calculate the new average weight of all the vehicles together. So, let's add the weight of the new vehicle to the total weight of the existing vehicles: Total weight before addition = 10 x 12.2 + New vehicle weight = 10 x 12.2 + X Where X represents the weight of the new heavy-duty truck. Now, according to the question, the average weight of the entire group including the new vehicle has increased by 2.6 tons. This means that the new average weight can be calculated as follows: New average weight = (Total weight before addition + New vehicle weight) / Number of vehicles after addition = (10 x 12.2 + X) / 11 = 12.2 + X/11 Since there are 11 vehicles after adding the new heavy-duty truck, we can simplify the equation as follows: New average weight = 12.2 + X/11 = 12.2 + 2.

A: Let's think step by step.There are 5000 voters in total, and 20% of them are not eligible to vote, so the actual number of valid votes = Total votes - Non-eligible votes = 5000 - 1000 = 4000. Now, let's assume that the winning candidate received x% of the total valid votes. Since he won by 15%, we can say that his share of the votes is 15% more than the other candidate's share. So, the winning candidate got (x + 15%) / 2 % of the total valid votes. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total valid votes the winning candidate got. To do this, we will divide the total number of votes he got by the total number of valid votes. So, the answer is A: 3267.

A: Let's think step by step.The cost of each fruit is directly proportional to its weight. So if we know the cost of one orange is 18 dollars, then the cost of two oranges would be twice that amount = 36 dollars. Similarly, if we know the cost of one pineapple is 27 dollars, then the cost of two pineapples would be twice that amount = 54 dollars. Now let's find out how much a mango costs. If one mango costs 15 dollars, then two mangos would cost twice that amount = 30 dollars. Therefore, option A is correct.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's think step by step.We know that Alloy X has a composition of 6:9 = 3/5 and Alloy Y has a composition of 7:11 = 2/5. When we mix these two alloys together, the total amount of zinc will be equal to the sum of the amounts of zinc in each alloy, i.e., 3 + 2 = 5. Similarly, the total amount of copper will also be equal to the sum of the amounts of copper in each alloy, i.e., 9 + 11 = 20. Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in the resulting alloy Z can be calculated as follows: Ratio of Zinc to Copper in Z = Total Amount of Zinc / Total Amount of Copper = 5 / 20 = 1/4 or 25%.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that at its highest speed, the space shuttle can climb 700 meters in 40 seconds. This means it has an average acceleration of:
a = h / t = 700 m / 40 s = 17.5 m/s^2
Now we need to find out how long it takes for the space shuttle to cover a distance of 1 meter. Since the space shuttle accelerates at a constant rate, we can use the formula:
time = distance / acceleration
So time taken to cover 1 meter = 1 m / 17.5 m/s^2 = 0.06 seconds.
Now let's convert this value from seconds to meters:
distance = time x velocity = 0.06 s x 17.5 m/s^2 = 1.05 meters
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is approximately 105 meters. The correct answer is (C).

A: Let's think step by step.If a number is divisible by both 9 and 12, then we know that its remainder when divided by 9 is zero, and its remainder when divided by 12 is also zero. So, let's try to find the multiples of X using these conditions. We can start with X = 10, because 10 × 9 = 90 and 10 × 12 = 120, both are correct. Now, let's check for other numbers. For example, if X = 15, then 15 × 9 = 135 and 15 × 12 = 180, neither of them is equal to zero. Therefore, option B, 15, is not the multiple of X that is divisible by 9 and 12. Similarly, if X = 17, then 17 × 9 = 153 and 17 × 12 = 194, none of them is equal to zero. Hence, option C, 17, is not the multiple of X that is divisible by 9 and 12. Option A, 36

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the rectangle has an area of $AB = x$ cm^2, where A is the top half and B is the bottom half. Since we have to find the area of both parts separately, we will call them as Part-I and Part-II.
Now, let's analyze the given information:
Perimeter of each part = 48 cm
So, we can write:
Part-I Perimeter = 48 cm
Part-II Perimeter = 66 cm
We also know that the total perimeter of the rectangle is twice its length, so:
Total Perimeter = 2(Length)
= 2(x)
Since the rectangle is divided into two equal parts, the length of each part is half the length of the original rectangle, which means:
Length of Part-I = Length of Part-II = x/2 cm
Now, we need to find the area of each part:
Area of Part-I = Area of Rectangle - AB = x - AB
Similarly,
Area of Part-II = Area of Rectangle - CD = x - CD
where CD is the diagonal of the rectangle.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that Train A leaves every 16 minutes, which means it covers a distance of 1/16 of the total distance in one trip. Similarly, Train B leaves every 17 minutes, covering a distance of 1/17 of the total distance in one trip. Since both trains have just left the station simultaneously, we can assume that their positions are equal after one trip. So, if the total distance is x kilometers, then the distance covered by each train in one trip is x / 16 for Train A and x / 17 for Train B. Now, to find out when they will meet again, we need to divide the total distance by the distance covered by each train in one trip: x / (x / 16) = x / (x / 17). Simplifying this equation gives us x = 350 km. Therefore, the answer is E: 35 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.The given condition states that the three consecutive integers are such that their product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729 = n(n-1)(n). Since we need to find the value of n, let's first simplify the expression for the product: 727 + 728 + 729 = 3x(3x - 1)(3x + 1) Now, we have a cubic equation in x: 3x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 Solving this equation, we get x = 17 So, the three consecutive integers are 17, 18, and 19 Their sum is: 17 + 18 + 19 = 54 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 30.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that in a class of 1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16 x 1/16 = 256 students who study math. Similarly, there are 10 x 1/10 = 100 students who study bio, and 8 x 1/8 = 100 students who study English. Therefore, the total number of students in the class is:
256 + 100 + 100 + X = Total Number of Students

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step.We know that the radius of the fan blade is 10 cm = 0.1 m. The angle subtended by each blade at the center is given by sin(θ) = 0.1/0.2 = 0.5. So, the angular displacement of the blade in one rotation is 2π × 0.5 = 1 radian. Now, we need to find out how many times the blade rotates in 30 seconds. Time taken for 1 rotation = RPM / (angular displacement per rotation). Since the fan runs at 300 RPM, time taken for 1 rotation = 300 x (1 radian/3600 degrees) = 1/3600 s. Therefore, the number of rotations in 30 seconds = 3600/1 = 3600 rotations. Now, let's find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the blade.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step.We know that out of 500 deer caught randomly in 2002, only 20 had tags from the previous year. So, the number of deer without tags in the 500-deer sample is 480 (500 - 20). Now, we need to find the percentage of deer in the entire forest with tags. To do this, we divide the number of deer with tags in the 500-deer sample by the total number of deer caught in both years: Number of deer with tags in the 500-deer sample = 20/500 = 0.04 or 4%. Total deer population in the forest = Number of deer caught in 2001 + Number of deer caught in 2002 - Number of deer caught in 2001 that also had tags in 2002 Total deer population in the forest = 300 + 500 - 20 = 580 deer.

A: Let's think step by step.According to the problem statement, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago. So, if Rahim's age at that time was x years, then Raj's age would be 1/3x years. Now, we are told that Raj is 17 years old now. Therefore, Rahim's current age can be calculated as follows: Rahim's age = 17 + (5 - 1/3x) years. Solving for x, we get: Rahim's age = 42 years. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer isD: 42 years old.

Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's think step by step.The event "a number chosen from S" means we choose any integer between 1 and 1,000 randomly. Now, let's check whether the number is relatively prime to 1,000 or not. If it shares a common factor with 1,000 other than 1, then it is not relatively prime to 1,000. So, the probability of an integer in S being relatively prime to 1,000 is:
Number of integers in S = 1 + 2 + ... + 1,000 = 1,001
Probability of choosing a relative prime number = Number of relative prime numbers / Total number of integers in S
= 1,001 / 1,001 = 1
So, the answer is A: 5/7.

A: Let's think step by step.We are given that the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers must divide into a perfect square. So we need to find out what is the least possible value for each number in the series and then check if it divides into a perfect square.
Let’s start with the first number in the series, which is 2x + 1 = 10. Since it is an odd number, its nearest perfect square is 10^2 = 100. Therefore, the minimum possible value of x is 5.
Now let’s move on to the second number in the series, which is 3x + 2 = 21. Its nearest perfect square is 21^2 = 441. Therefore, the minimum possible value of x is 8.
Similarly, we can continue this process for all the remaining three numbers in the series as follows:
For the third number, 4x + 3 = 35, its nearest perfect square is 35^2 = 1225. Therefore, the minimum possible value of x is 10.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that U is the midpoint of line segment ST, so we can write U = (x + x') / 2, where (x', y') is the point of ST. Now, let's find the distance between R and U:
Distance(R, U) = √((x - x')^2 + (y - y')^2)
= √((3)^2 + (4)^2)
= √(9 + 16)
= √25

Now, we need to find the length of line segment RU. Since RU is a straight line, its length is equal to the distance between R and U:
Length(RU) = Distance(R, U)
= √25

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters, so we can start with that information to find out its dimensions. The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length x Width, where Length and Width are the dimensions of the rectangle. Since we have been told that the length is one meter more than four times the width, we can write this relationship in terms of the length and width: Length = 4Width + 1. Now we need to use this equation along with the fact that the area is equal to the product of the length and width to solve for the perimeter. Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). So if we substitute the values we know into these equations, we get: Perimeter = 2(4Width + 1 + Width) = 2(5Width + 1) = 100 m. Therefore, the answer is option (A): 60 m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is60 m.

A: Let's think step by step.We are given that if 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. So we can write an equation based on this information:
2/3x - 10 = 40 + 1/3x
Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 10 to both sides of the equation:
2/3x = 50
Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2/3:
x = 50 / 2/3

A: Let's think step by step.We are given that the product of two numbers is 25, and one number is 12 times the other. So we can write:
Number 1 × Number 2 = 25
Number 1 = 12 × Number 2
Now we need to find out what Number 2 is. We know that Number 2 is 5 times Number 1, so we can write:
Number 2 = Number 1 × 5
Substituting the value of Number 1 from the first equation, we get:
Number 2 = 12 × 5
So Number 2 is equal to 60.

A: Let's think step by step.The total amount spent on trousers = Number of trousers x Cost per pair = 810 x 70 = 56,400. Similarly, the total amount spent on shirts = Number of shirts x Cost per shirt = 810 x 30 = 24,300. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of trousers can be bought with the money spent on both trousers and shirts. Total amount spent = 56,400 + 24,300 = 80,700. Ratio of trousers to shirts = Total amount spent on trousers / Total amount spent = 56,400 / 80,700 = 7/10 or 70%. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B): 8 Trousers.

A: Let's think step by step.The due date of the invoice is 30 days from the date of the invoice. So, if the merchant borrows money on day 4 and pays it back on day 30, there will be no interest charge since the payment falls within the discount period. Therefore, the highest simple interest rate that the merchant can afford to pay is the annual rate that equals the discount percentage (n). In this case, the discount percentage is 100%, so the highest simple interest rate = n = 100%. Hence, the answer is (A) 247.67.

A: Let's think step by step.For machine A, it takes 6 minutes to produce one yo-yo, so in 6 minutes, it produces 1 yo-yo. To find the number of yo-yos produced by both machines combined in 10 minutes, we can multiply their individual production rates: Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 10 minutes, it produces 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 5 yo-yos. Similarly, Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 10 minutes, it produces 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 5 yo-yos too! Therefore, after 10 minutes, both machines together will have produced 10 yo-yos.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that both Ram and Krishna are moving in opposite directions with different speeds. So, we can use the concept of relative speed = difference in speeds / sum of speeds. In this case, the relative speed between Ram and Krishna is: Relative speed = 40 m/s - 20 m/s = 20 m/s Now, let's find out how much time it takes for them to meet each other.

A: Let's think step by step.The question states that every member of the family earns money each month. So, we can assume that all family members have an income. Now, let's calculate the total income of the family based on the given information: Total Income = Median Income x Number of Members = $3000 x ??? We know that the total income of the family is $9000, so we can set up the equation: $3000x + $6000 = $9000 Now, we need to solve for "x" which represents the number of members in the family. To do this, we can subtract $6000 from both sides of the equation: $3000x - $6000 = $9000 Subtracting $6000 from both sides gives us: $3000x = $30000 / 2 This means that there are 2 members in the family since the total income divided by the median income is equal to twice the number of members.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet = 9 x 1 = 9 square feet. Now, we need to find the length of each of the painted sides. Since the sum of their lengths is equal to 37 feet, we can write: Length of one side + Length of another side + Length of third side = 37 feet Length of first side + Length of second side + Length of third side = 37 feet × 3 = 111 feet So, the length of each of the painted sides is 111 / 3 = 37 feet. Area of each painted side = Length x Width = 37 x 9 = 333 square feet Total area of the parking space = Area of each painted side × Number of painted sides = 333 x 3 = 999 square feet Therefore, the answer is option (A): 46 square feet.

Q: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
A: Let's think step by step.We know that if the maximum mark M is converted to 800 marks, then we can write:
M x = 800 x
Now, we are given that the candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark M. So, we can write:
504 = M x / 800
Now, simplify and solve for M:
M = 800 x / 504
M = 1600
So, the value of M is 1600. Therefore, option A is correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A) 278.

Q: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's think step by step.The total amount of money that Charles received after one year is given as $54,080. This includes both the original principal amount and the interest earned on it. So we can set up the equation: Principal + Interest = Total Amount Received. Now, we know that the interest rate is 8% per year, compounded semi-annually, so the interest earned in one year is half of the interest rate times the principal, or 8%/2 = 4% of the principal. Therefore, the principal amount is: Principal = Total Amount Received / (Interest Rate % + 1) = $54,080 / (4% + 1) = $54,080 / 5 = $10,816 Original Principal Amount = $10,816.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's think step by step.We know that one gram of this health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin A. So we can write: Vitamin E = 0.09 x Grams/day Vitamin A = 0.08 x Grams/day Now, we want to determine how much of this health food needs to be consumed each day to meet the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins. To do this, we need to set up an equation using these two expressions: Vitamin E + Vitamin A = Minimum Daily Requirement For Both Vitamins Solving for Grams/day, we get: Grams/day = (Minimum Daily Requirement For Both Vitamins / (Vitamin E + Vitamin A)) Therefore, if the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins is 100 units, then: Grams/day = (100 / (0.09 + 0.08)) = 12.5 (Answer choice B).

A: Let's think step by step.The area of the field is given as 10 square feet per day. So, if we divide this value by the length of the rope (which is 14 feet), we get the number of times the cow can graze the field in one day: Area = Length x Width = 10 / 14 = 0.7142 (approximately). Now, since the cow takes 1 day to graze the entire field, it means that the field is divided into equal parts, and each part takes approximately 0.7142 days for the cow to graze completely.

Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.The total amount is Rs. 5100. If we want both brothers to get an equal amount after 3 years, then each brother should get Rs. 1700 (Rs. 5100 / 2). Now, if we invest this money at 4% interest per year, the future value of each brother's share would be: FV = P x (1 + r)^n Where: FV = Future Value P = Present Value r = Interest rate n = Number of years Since the brothers are getting equal amounts when they turn 26, let's say Mohan's share is FV1 and Sohan's share is FV2. We can set up the equation as follows: FV1 = FV2 = Rs. 1700 x (1 + 0.04)^(3) = Rs. 1700 x 1.04^3 = Rs. 2680 Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2680.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that volume of cube = side length^3 and volume of sphere = (4/3)πr^3, where r is radius of sphere. Now we want to find the ratio of volume of sphere that fits inside cube to the volume of cube. So let's set up the problem as follows: Volume of sphere that fits inside cube = Volume of cube Now, we can use the formula for volume of sphere to get rid of the radical term: Volume of sphere that fits inside cube = (4/3)πr^3 / Side length^3 = (4/3)π(side length)^(-1) Now, we are given that the side length of the cube is x. So, the volume of the sphere that fits inside the cube is: Volume of sphere that fits inside cube = (4/3)πx^(-1) Now, we need to find the ratio of this volume to the volume of the entire cube. So, we divide both sides of the equation by x^3: Ratio of volume of sphere that fits inside cube to volume of cube = (4/3)π / x^3 Now, we have our answer in terms of pi. So, option A is correct!
