            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. We know that the total amount of sugar, flour, and salt needed for the recipe is 11 + 6 + 9 = 26 cups. Since Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, we can subtract this amount from the total amount of ingredients needed: 26 - 12 = 14 cups. So, Mary needs to add 14 cups of sugar and 0 cups of salt (since she has already added 9 cups).",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. If Emily made 6 necklaces, then the total number of beads used must be equal to 6 times the number of beads per necklace. Since there are 18 beads in total, we can write the equation: 6 x Number of beads per necklace = 18 Now, let's solve for the number of beads per necklace: Number of beads per necklace = 18 / 6 So, each necklace needed approximately 3 beads.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. You have read 13 books from the \"crazy silly school\" series, which means that you still need to read 8 more books. So, the total number of books in this series is 13 + 8 = 21 books.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. We know that the frog jumped x inches more than the grasshopper. So, if the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, then the frog jumped x + 19 = 39 inches. Now we can find out how far the mouse jumped by subtracting its distance from the frog's distance: Mouse jumped x + 19 - 39 = -20 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the mouse jumped 49 inches.",
