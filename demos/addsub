Tomorrow, workers will plant 2 more dogwood trees, so now there are 10 + 2 = 12 dogwood trees in the park. Therefore, when the workers are finished, there will be 12 dogwood trees in the park.",

To find out how many limes were picked in total, we need to add the number of limes each person picked. So, let's do that: 25 + 32 = 57 So, a total of 57 limes were picked.",

Now, we are told that there are 3263 algae plants in the lake, which has caused it to turn green. To find out how many more algae plants are present in the lake now, we need to subtract the initial number of algae plants from the current number. So, the answer is: 3263 - 809 = 2454 Therefore, there are 2454 additional algae plants in Milford Lake compared to its original state.",
